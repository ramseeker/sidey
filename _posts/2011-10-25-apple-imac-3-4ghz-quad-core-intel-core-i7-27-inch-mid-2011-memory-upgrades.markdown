**Apple iMac 3.4GHz Quad-Core Intel-Core i7 (27-inch – DDR3) Mid 2011**




By industry and end user standards, the fastest performance available on the Mac platform has generally been found on the MacBook Pro product line.  However, with the introduction of the **Apple  iMac 3.4GHz Quad-Core Intel-Core i7 (27-inch – DDR3) Mid 2011**, Apple created a desktop every bit as fast as its recently released quad core MacBook Pro models released early in 2011.

Apple iMac 3.4GHz Quad-Core Intel-Core i7 27-inch was technically considered to be a ‘configure to order’ upgraded version of the standard 27 inch quad core i5 iMac. The iMac 3.4 GHz i7 was powered by a _Quad Core_ 3.4 GHz Intel “Core i7” I7-2600 (Sandy Bridge) processor with a dedicated 256k level 2 cache for each core and an 8 MB shared level 3 cache. With a “Direct Media Interface” (DMI) that “connects between the processor and chipset” at 5 GT/s and replaces the system buss.




If only the processor was customized, model is configured with 4 GB of RAM (1333 MHz PC3-10600 DDR3 SDRAM), a 1 TB (7200 RPM) hard drive, and AMD Radeon HD 6970M graphics with 1 GB of dedicated GDDR5 memory.
