I thought I was a goner.

A new wide angle lens, a nice summers’ eve and a bridge to walk up seems like a good idea, yes?




**Until you do it.**




Things I must remember before walking up to the top of a bridge above the niagara river:






  1. 



I can’t swim






  1. 



I’m afraid of heights.




It started off as a nice little adventure.  I left BW at home reading a book, grabbed the camera and my old school manual focus lens and I was off.

And from the bottom of the Grand Island Bridge, this wasn’t such a bad idea…




But as I walked up to the top I realized something else: the bridge shakes! A lot! The sidewalk is designed for passengers and all but boy can you feel every shake, rattle and roll the bridge makes as the traffic whizzes by.

and I sure as heck wasn’t going to look down over the railing **at all that water **[![Boaters](http://jim.am/images /2012/08/JIM_8365.jpg)](http://jim.am/images /2012/08/JIM_8365.jpg)




But I soldiered on and made it to the top of the bridge.

and then before you know it, it got dark.

And I rode off into the sunset…

The End.
