We haven't left the house in **days**. In fact, I can't even remember when the last time was we went anywhere other than around the block for a walk. So, we have not had much need for a mask as we're all snuggled in the house.

But. BW's mother was making some homemade masks and said she would mail us a couple when done. Great, right?

The homemade face masks show up and they look fine and considering they were free and we don't go anywhere anyway I thought that these would be just fine. They fit. They're a little hot to wear indoors but we only plan on staying in anyway, so great.

Masks. Done.


All is good until I get the one made for me strapped on my head and then BW says: "**These are pretty good for old diapers!**"

Um..."**whose diapers**"? I ask.

"**Mine**"

Turns out my MIL has kept old cloth diapers for **over 40 years** because, you know - you never know when you might have a need for an old cloth diaper from the 70's.

You have never seen a guy rip a mask off his face so fast. Diapers? Really?

Yes. Diapers.

I don't think I'm ever going outside again. I might need to use a mask.
