“OOH, the Venus Transit is next week!” she excitedly said.




And with those few words, my new to-do item on the honey-do list was to make B a pinhole camera so she could watch the venus transfer without harm to her eyeballs.




I really don’t get the space/nerd thing she’s got going on but then she’s not quite understanding of my love for speakers so I guess it all works out.




I searched the internet  for pinhole camera instructions and found a box to make her a pinhole camera:

And at exactly 6:03 pm, this happened:

But, there was a problem. We could see the sun, but no transfer of venus. Maybe we were early, so we waited and tried again:

Still nothing. So, what if we sat down? Surely that might help…

Nope, nothing.




Did I make the camera wrong? It’s a possibility as this was the very first pinhole camera I made. So, I found a different design that didn’t require you to sit in the backyard with a box on your head ( I told you today’s post was going to be a doozy)

See that little white dot? That’s the sun, so  at least we got that right but still  - no sign of venus travelling across it.




Then, we gave up and watched it happen live on the internet with tea and cookies. The End.




At least [the dog](http://jim.am/the-dog/) had fun. No box required.
