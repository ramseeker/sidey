I have been toying with this idea for some time but I think it's time to get rid of the PC I have. It's an HP Elitedesk 800 G1 with 16GB of RAM and a 256GB hard drive and It bought it for a song so I have no qualms about selling it as I will probably make a few bucks.

It's...fine.It runs Windows, Linux and any other OS. Heck, with some hacking I could make it a Hackintosh. But here's the thing. I don't need it. I'm fine with my Chromebook as it [runs Linux](https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/9145439?hl=en) just fine and offers the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store?hl=en_US) as well so there's  really no need for much more.

I thought I needed windows so I could stream [Tidal](https://jim.am/tidal-hifi/) to my high resolution audio gear but I due to age I guess, I can't determine an audible difference between Tidal vs YouTube Music and seeing as we already have an [Google Play Music](https://play.google.com/music) Family Subscription it doesn't make sense to spend $20 a month more for differences I can't hear.

And considering all I need to write is a relatively fast-ish PC and a linux command line to build the site in [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), I'm good. The Chromebook does all of this, and more.

Also, Windows 10 isn't really all that bad anymore, but it's a learning curve I don't want to have to try and flatten as we're already trying to ##flattenthecurve and that one matters much more.
