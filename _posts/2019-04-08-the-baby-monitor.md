This isn't a real review as there are others that do the job for me much better, but I just wanted to share how much I actually enjoy this baby monitor. It was a gift - like a lot of the other things that our newborn have and I really did not have high hopes for this thing but it turns out I was wrong.

It's really a great monitor. I wish it was wireless, because - wires, but  other than that it's been a pretty neat device. It has a slew of features that I will never use like playing lullabies and two way conversations but for keeping an ear out for the baby while  she sleeps in the other room it's pretty fantastic.

The best feature has to be the ECO mode.  You can set the sensitivity to when the monitor itself wakes up  but unless it does wake up the thing is silent. I have it so that it the baby is just babbling away in bed I won't hear it or get alerted  to it but if she starts to scream then the sound and the video goes on. Not only does the sound alert you to you crying baby but the video tends to light up a dark room just like a phone would and that helps you wake up and see what the problem is.

So far, this baby monitor has not let me down and has been a very good too when raising a newborn.
