**Too much.**




Apple MacBook Pro Memory Upgrades for much less than Apple charges:




That’s what it costs for the **Apple Store to add ram to your Mac **as not only will you have to **pay more for Apple memory** than what you could buy elsewhere for even name brand RAM, which tends to be on the pricier side of things anyway such as [Kingston Memory](http://www.kingston.com) or [Crucial memory,](http://amzn.to/2oA2gjC) but you also have to endure the inconvenience of physically taking your Mac to the Apple Store,  and maybe it’s just  my bad luck but in the few times I have been to an Apple Store, the stores have always been packed with  people which a great  thing for Apple, as they sell more [iPods](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002M3SO0G/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ramseeker-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002M3SO0G), [iPads](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002C74BNG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ramseeker-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002C74BNG) and [Apple Mac Computers](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26node%3D172282%26ref_%3Dbl_sr_pc%26field-brandtextbin%3DApple&tag=ramseeker-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957) but for the Macintosh user who **just wants more ram installed**, regardless of what Mac you wish to upgrade and that’s to **install the Apple RAM yourself** and save money on memory upgrades in the process.




Let’s use a **13 inch MacBook Pro** as an example, as it currently is the **[best selling notebook](http://www.jim.am/best-notebook-computers-of-2011/)** – regardless of computer manufacturer, so there’s definitely a market not only for this article, but for cheap and good MacBook Pro RAM overall that’s much cheaper than what Apple charges for RAM. As I write this to double the RAM on a new MacBook Pro will cost you $400 for 8GB of  13 inch MacBook Pro Memory.

**[Much Cheaper Apple Memory](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ramseeker-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW)**




 




Compare that to third party memory stores where you can buy the same **[8GB MacBook Pro Memory](http://www.jim.am/memory/MacBook_Pro_DDR3_1333Mhz_Memory_Upgrade_Kits-8gb/)** for under $100.  I don’t know about you but I sure don’t have an extra $300 to spend for the priveledge of **buying ram from Apple** when I can buy pretty much the same memory for less, much less. **75% savings off $400 for MacBook Pro RAM** is nothing to sneeze at, and if I do feel the need to give Apple more money I can do so with the purchase of an **iPod** or even use the savings on Apple RAM towards an **Apple iPad**.




To be fair, the **[cheapest RAM for MacBook Pros](http://www.jim.am/cheapest-apple-MacBook Pro-memory-upgrades/)**are going to come as **generic RAM,** And although  it’s not specified there’s a very good chance your new MacBook Pro will ship with name brand memory upgrades.  The last MacBook I bought had **[Micron RAM ](http://amzn.to/2oA2gjC)**installed at default, which even though it’s name brand still only  has a street price of about $100 or perhaps a bit over. You’ll be fine with RAM from third party memory stores that are established online RAM vendors who sell a **quality generic RAM product**.




Now the best part. You can **install RAM yourself** for any current and discontinued Mac and in the case of the current Macs adding RAM upgrades yourself will not void your Apple limited warranty and [Apple even provides memory upgrade instructions](http://www.jim.am/cheapest-apple-MacBook Pro-memory-upgrades/) that will help you with the task of a memory install yourself.




I see no reason to either buy RAM from Apple either online, or direct as the cost is very high compared to much **[cheaper Apple Memory upgrade options](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ramseeker-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW)**
