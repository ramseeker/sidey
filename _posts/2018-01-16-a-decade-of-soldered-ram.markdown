Ten Years.




Boy does time go fast. I was reading this morning that it’s been [10 years of the MacBook Air ](https://john.do/the-macbook-air/) and I realized that the MacBook Air introduction was the beginning of the end and now in 2018 with a [few exceptions](https://www.apple.com/imac/)it’s all soldered RAM on Apple computers.




![](https://jim.am/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/background-board-card-825262.jpg)say goodbye to ram upgrades




At first I thought that this was a bad thing, and I think it was in the days of MacBook Air models shipping with just 2GB of RAM but [now the standard config is 8GB](https://www.apple.com/macbook-air/specs/) I think that for most users 8GB is enough - I know it is for me.




I know that if you’re a power user or pro then a MacBook Air with 8GB might not be enough ram for you but for the most of us it is. Soldered RAM gives us the ability to have computers like the MacBook Air which I doubt we would have otherwise.




It doesn’t seem so long ago that the PowerBook G4 at 1 inch thick was the epitome of thin  for a laptop computer but the MacBook Air and it’s lack of ram upgrades combined with the removal of the CD drive changed that and now almost every other notebook today is a MacBook Air clone.




So it seems like we’re stuck with soldered ram for the future as even the last notebook from Apple you could upgrade the RAM on is[ now 6 years old](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201300).  In a way I miss the ram upgrades and the prices I tracked but overall I think that soldered ram is good.




I know some of you that want to tinker or [squeeze every last drop out of their Mac](http://lowendmac.com) will disagree but  I bet a lot of consumers just buy a MacBook Air and use it without having to worry about upgrades.




Upgrades were a hassle. Yes, you could double the ram from the amount that shipped from Apple but it was costly, confusing on what ram you needed to buy and in some cases you got bad ram or bought it from shady vendor. All this goes away with  Soldered RAM.




Yes, RAM upgrades from Apple are [ a lot of money](https://jim.am/2011/01/should-i-add-memory-from-the-apple-store/) and you could do better with third party ram but I think that applied more in the earlier years. Sure, you pay more for a Macbook Air but not enough where I think that if you needed a Mac with maxed out RAM it matters. If you’re going to pay over a grand for a Mac, what’s another hundred bucks or so to future proof it for a few more years?




Soldered RAM is here to stay. The days of ram upgrades for  your mac are over.
