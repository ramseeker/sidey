John Saddington on getting a million page views:




<blockquote>If I were to give any words of advice to those seeking to reach their first 1 million pageviews it would be the following:Do the Work – Just hit “Publish,” period. Forget your insecurities since everyone’s got them. You have nothing to lose.
