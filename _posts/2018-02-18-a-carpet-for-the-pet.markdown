It started out as a slow Saturday but then I suggested that after lunch we go out and buy the blinds she wanted.




Today’s Lesson: Do not go to Home Depot with your wife. She will find stuff to organize and beautify the house with.

We bought it, and **only after** did we realize it might not fit in the Honda. Thankfully, it did.




And I don’t think there’s  anybody in the house that’s **more thankful** than the dog about our new purchase.
