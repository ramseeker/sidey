It should be called freaking cold friday because that’s what it was. 12 degrees when I woke up and not much warmer later in the day so today’s efforts was to bundle up and walk out the front door, grab this photo of the snow and then back indside. Will try to be more adventurous tomorrow. There’s been talk about christmas tree shopping soon…
