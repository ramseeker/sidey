If you don't yet have a [wubbanub](https://amzn.to/30FmMld) you're missing out if you have a kid that still need a pacifier.

I know, it's a cheap stuff toy stapled to the end of a 1 dollar pacifier and they sell for close to $20 but they work well. My little one is still a little too young for figuring out that if you hold it the **pacifier will stay in**, but that will come eventually.

I love this because it's a stuffed animal that is not only great for the child, but for the parents too. This seems to have a less chance of getting lost vs just the small pacifiers we are used to.
