I never thought I would write about a high chair, but here I am.

This was a gift when she was born, and I have to tell you now that she's bigger this has sure come in handy. I toss her in this at least 6 times a day for feeding and snacks.
 
One reason I like this is that it's small, lightweight and **portable** which means you can toss it in the trunk and take it with you to restaurants where it's much easier to feed her in this thing than the [big and bulky](https://amzn.to/2VveU3Y) things you think of when you think of high chairs. (at least I do)

At first, I was not in love with this chair as it seems to be pretty light and it was a struggle getting the tray to *click* in but now that we have had it for some time it seems we have the technique down pat when it comes go getting her in and out of it and fed.

It's also **pretty easy to clean** which is something that one doesn't really think of too much when [buying dining chairs](https://amzn.to/2XuGcdz) for adults but boy, does **she spill a lot** so it's very nice that this wipes up quick.

One complaint would be the straps get a little grubby after a while but they are removable so you can toss 'em in the wash when they get too dirty.

When it comes to restaurants - not that we do a lot of it anyway - and never now to COVID-19, this chair is easy to grab with one hand and bring into the restaurant with you and it probably takes up less room than the high chair from them.

It's also surprisingly stable. It looks **top heavy** but she's bigger now  and has discovered she can wiggle and lean in the thing and to my amazement really she hasn't toppled over when in this chair (yet).

Some stuff you buy for kids is pure crap and just plastic overload but this chair actually looks not bad for a kids high chair too.
