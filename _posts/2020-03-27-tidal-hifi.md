I found an offer for 4 months of [Tidal](http://tidal.com) for four bucks a month so I thought I would give it a shot and see if I could tell a difference 
between sound quality of Tidal vs YouTube Music - which I am already paying for. 

Spoiler: I can't 

I would love to tell you that I can but I don't think I would be telling the truth.  Just as well, because [YouTube Music](http://music.youtube.com) is already paid for and I get a lot more value from it, even if the quality of sound isn't high res. 

The trouble, I don't think my ears are "high resolution" any more. Not to say I am deaf by any stretch but I'm no spring chicken any more and I think the high frequencies are for the young whippersnippers and not me.  :)

So, I have until July to see if I can't convice myself otherwise, but for now I will stay with YouTube Music. I even took one of those tests online where you try and guess the MP3 vs the high resolution recording in a blind test, and I was only right about 30 percent of the time and mostly that was just luck I think. 

I also don't care for the exeprience of Tidal. It seems like I can't find what I want to listen to easily, but perhaps the user experience would grow on me but it didn't at first blush. 

There's also the cost. This costs $20 a month. At $240.00 a year, it's not a horrible price to pay (remember what we used to pay for ONE CD?) but it's a little more money that doesn't need to be going out the door.
