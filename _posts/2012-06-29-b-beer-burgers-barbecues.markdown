Tonight,  when it came time to call it a day  when it comes to our workday, we fired  up the grill..![](http://jim.am/images/2012/06/JIM_4824.jpg)




Had some fun, while waiting. ?

Listened to the NPR

Had Burgers for Dinner

Plain ones too!

Then we watered our plants and  then buzzed over to the neighbours house to water theirs while they’re on holidays. And, along  the way we wondered why the house across the street didn’t sell. It’s cheap.

When we arrived,  we watered purple flowers

Well, OK. B watered the flowers - I documented the event.

But we watered green ones too.
