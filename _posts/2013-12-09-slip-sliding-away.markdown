The plan was to mosey around the block and find some neighbours with nice christmas lights. But, seeing as how we live in Buffalo mother nature had other plans and it’s freezing rain and slippery out there so after three close calls I’d done enough suffering out in the cold for my art and this photo of me almost going down on attempt number 2 will have to do for today’s effort.
