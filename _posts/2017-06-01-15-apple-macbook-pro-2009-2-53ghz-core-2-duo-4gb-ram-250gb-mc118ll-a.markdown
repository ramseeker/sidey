This used 2009 Apple MacBook Pro sells for [about $400](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?ff3=4&toolid=11800&pub=5575019070&campid=5337133045&mpre=http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_odkw=2009%2bmabook%2bpro&_osacat=0&_from=R40&_trksid=p2045573.m570.l1311.R1.TR12.TRC2.A0.H0.X2009%2bmacbook%2bpro.TRS0&_nkw=2009%2bmacbook%2bpro&_sacat=0) on sale, but if you’re patient you can usually find one for less. This particular model seems to be in pretty good shap and it’s priced out a little more.




## Replace the Hard Drive




This particular MacBook Pro comes with 4GB of RAM and a 250GB hard drive. The spinner hard drives on these models were fast in their day but you should add a SSD drive for much faster performance. A [250GB replacement SSD](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?ff3=4&toolid=11800&pub=5575019070&campid=5337133045&mpre=http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_nkw=250gb%2bssd&_sacat=0&_fsrp=1) shouldn’t cost you more than $100.00 or so.




## Add More RAM




This MacBook Pro ships with 4GB, [but about $50.00](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?ff3=4&toolid=11800&pub=5575019070&campid=5337133045&mpre=http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_odkw=8gb%2bddr3%2bsodimm&_osacat=0&_from=R40&_trksid=p2045573.m570.l1313.TR4.TRC1.A0.H0.X8gb%2bddr3%2bsodimm%2bkit.TRS0&_nkw=8gb%2bddr3%2bsodimm%2bkit&_sacat=0) would get you double that to 8GB and max out the ram you can can use.




## Replace the Battery




This is a 2009 MacBook Pro so chances are the battery has seen some use. 2009 MacBook Pro batteries [cost about $35.00](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?ff3=4&toolid=11800&pub=5575019070&campid=5337133045&mpre=http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_odkw=2009%2bMacBook%2bPro%2bbattery&_osacat=0&_from=R40&_trksid=p2045573.m570.l1313.TR0.TRC0.H0.TRS0&_nkw=2009%2bMacBook%2bPro%2bbattery&_sacat=0) for a third party battery




## Need a Charger?




Some computers you buy might not come with a charger, but that’s easily remedied with a new charger for the 2009 Macbook Pro and will [cost about $20.00](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?ff3=4&toolid=11800&pub=5575019070&campid=5337133045&mpre=http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_odkw=2009%2bMacBook%2bPro%2bbattery&_osacat=0&_from=R40&_trksid=p2045573.m570.l1313.TR2.TRC1.A0.H0.X2009%2bMacBook%2bPro%2bcharger.TRS0&_nkw=2009%2bMacBook%2bPro%2bcharger&_sacat=0)




## Total 2009 MacBook Pro Upgrade Cost




Assuming you paid $400 for the MacBook Pro the RAM, Battery and SSD upgrades would set you back another $185.00 bringing the total cost for a 2009 MacBook Pro to just under $600.00 for a maxed out model with a fast SSD. If you do need a charger then you are over that price by another $20.00
