Short Answer: You’re better off just **[buying cheap MacBook Pro RAM](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ramseeker-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW)** than interchanging RAM upgrades.




The answer to the question on whether you can **swap out the RAM from an Apple iMac to an Apple MacBook Pro** depends on what specific **Apple iMac** and what specific **Apple MacBook Pro** you want to change or switch the memory from as all [MacBook Pro ram upgrades](http://www.jim.am) are not the same as all [iMac memory upgrades,](http://www.jim.am/memory/iMac_(DDR3_1333)/) so you need to be very specific what exact Apple model you wish to perform this task with, as the  answer to this could depend:Yes or No.




![Buy RAM for MacBook Pro ](http://www.jim.am/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-30-at-1.31.36-PM.png)I  guess my first question is considering the **[cheap price of Apple Memory](http://www.jim.am)** these days and that for both the **Apple iMac and the MacBook Pro RAM is so cheap**, why don’t you just **[buy more MacBook Pro memory](http://www.jim.am/memory)** and be done with it. As I see it, you want to **remove RAM from Apple iMac** and **Install RAM on MacBook Pro** but my question is **why**?




This will leave you with an **Apple iMac with too little RAM,** or at very least not enough ram or less RAM than you had  before in the iMac and  **more RAM in the MacBo0k Pro**. I don’t recommend this and really except for  a few rare instances (16GB for MBP)  and bigger ram upgrades for Mac Pro – all **[Apple memory upgrades](http://www.jim.am/news/apple)** should for the most part ship for under $100 for 8GB of RAM which not the maximum RAM on either machines, sounds to me like a better idea than what you’ve got planned.




But yes (**again, I don’t recommend this.  Do so at your own risk..etc**) if you want to or need to **swap RAM from an iMac to MacBook Pro** you can, but you have to pay attention to the speed of memory in both machines. In the case of the **latest iMacs which were announced summer 2010** and the MacBook Pros just announced last month, these two do accept DDR3 SDRAM sodimms that could (have I mentioned I don’t recommend this?) be swapped from an iMac to a MacBook Pro.




You’re much better off **[buying new RAM for the MacBook Pro](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ramseeker-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW)** and leaving the  RAM inside the Apple iMac
