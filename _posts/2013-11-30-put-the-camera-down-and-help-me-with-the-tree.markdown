As I had mentioned earlier I thought that today might be the day that we purchase the christmas tree and it was. BW was so excited she couldn’t sleep and was awake much to0 early compared to her usual time and once the caffeine kicked in it was “Okay Jimmy, let’s go get the tree”.  So off we went, off to Tim Hortons first, and then to the tree stand up the road.




Of course, BW wanted the expensive tree (now that she has the [fancy camera bag](http://jim.am/my-new-camera-bag/), it’s nothing but the best for her) but I talked her out of it by targeting her weakness: food. I suggested we buy the cheaper tree and use the saved money to go for chinese food. (this works every time). Also now that we’ve got the fancy SUV tossing a tree in was much easier.




The tree is up, and now I have to vacuum out dog hair (you know who you are) and pine cones from the car but that’s the price you pay for being a tidy husband.




At least there’s Chinese Food in my future.
