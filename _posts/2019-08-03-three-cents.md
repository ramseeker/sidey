In the past when I had much more popular websites with more traffic and more demanding backends I would spend about $300 a month on web hosting. Now, thanks to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and [firebase](http://firebase.google.com) it cost me 3 pennies for a month of hosting for this site as well as a few others.
