It seems like every post I write recently has the word **coronavirus** in it. This wasn't the plan when I started writing again here, but I guess with how much it's disrupting our lives every day it's understandble.

Anyway, the plan..before all this Corona stuff was that BW was going to go away. And then, things changed and everybody stays inside.

It then became **my responsibility** to cancel her flight, because **nobody** is going anywhere until this is all over.

About 3 weeks ago I went online at [delta](http://delta.com) and applied for a refund. Of course, it never showed after 3 weeks. So I had to call. I hate calling.

Then I waited. About a half an hour. In the time it took me to get somebody on the phone at Delta, I managed to configure a server at [vultr](http://vultr.com) so that I  can blog easier.

When I do get the CS Rep, she's nice and tells me as of right now, the flight is **not cancelled**, so no refund. Even though nobody is flying they of course won't cancel her flight in 2 weeks because on their end they are being overly optimistic that her flight will still...fly.

So the best I could get was a credit. There was some back and forth here between us about what we should do, but it's always better to **take the credit** and then worry about some future thing that may or may not happen.

Bird in the hand, and all that. According to the representative,they are so backed up that it will be a month or so before my credit is posted online but I have a ticket number, so I should be good. The Delta Airlines Credit is good for 2 years until May 22.

We are not big flyers (especially now) but I guess we will have to find some place to go between now and then.

Maybe we will go to DisneyLand.
