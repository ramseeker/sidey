Since crossing over to the dark side of married life, there’s been a few things that tend to be different here in the good ‘ol USA. Not only do I stand in amazement and wonder at the cereal aisle at the local Wegmans, I am also confronted by new and unfamiliar signposts at home too.




Take tea for example. Because BW comes with an Argentinian background and family history there are many boxes in our cupboards that _makadanosense_ to me, and the examples above are one such example. Tea is pretty big for the both of us. Despite the fact that I’m known for my coffee consumption, I have been known to drink the other hot beverage from time to time.




In fact, it’s our nightly routine to share a cup of tea together at day’s end, so it’s not like I’m a stranger to Tea. Heck, even thedog is named after what looks a lot to me, like Tea.




_we now break for obligitory photo of thedog: _

Now, back to the Tea.




You see, a couple nights ago we were well into our routine on tea making when BW called from upstairs: “ I’ll have a Boldo”




“What’s a Boldo?” I asked,




“It’s Tea - it’s in the cupboard with the other teas”, she says “Boldo is for the stomach, and Tilo is for Stress”




I then ask her what Boldo tastes like, and BW says it tastes like a herbal tea.




I then ask what Tilo tastes like because, surely it all can’t be the same.




“It tastes like Boldo” she says




Now, this is where I went.. **huh? ** This was not the answer I was expecting at all. I mean**, how can two teas taste alike?** especially when they’re designed for different purposes? I mean, the stomach tea and the stress tea taste the same? really?




The takeaway: All Tea pretty much tastes the same, rergardless of name or country of origin.




That, and you can never have enough photos of thedog.
