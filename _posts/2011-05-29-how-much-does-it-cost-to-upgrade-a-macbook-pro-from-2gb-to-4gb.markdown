[Not much at all. ](http://amzn.to/2oA2gjC)




You can double the RAM in your MBP to 4GB very easily and cheaply just by adding more memory. You’ll  need to buy new ram upgrades and replace the ram  in your MacBook Pro – currently 2x1GB MacBook Pro RAM  with larger 2×2 GB RAM for MacBook Pros but the cost is negligible, especially if you are making your living with your MacBook Pro adding another 2gb of RAM will be like breathing a breath of fresh air into now what will be a discontinued MacBook Pro, as the current MBP’s take 8GB of DDR3 SDRAM.




I don’t know what specific model of MacBook Pro you’re looking to ugprade, but you should  be able to do so for not  much money at all. MacBook Pro models that accept 4GB are now, in 2011 a few years old and you could be looking to squeeze more life out of a 2009, 2010 or even 2008 MacBook Pro notebook, as these all max out with 4GB of memory.




You’ll be in the market for DDR3 1066 SDRAM dimms and a s you can see by the MacBook Pro RAM Price chart below RAM for MacBooks is cheaper than it has ever been before and  continues to drop in price over time, so if you want, you can wait until ram prices fall even further. But the disadvantage of this approach is that your’e sacrificing your time over money when the benefit of the ram will far outweigh the costs of a 4GB RAM upgrade for a MacBook Pro.
