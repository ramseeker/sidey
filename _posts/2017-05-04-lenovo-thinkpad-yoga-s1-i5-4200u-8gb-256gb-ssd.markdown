## Lenovo Thinkpad Yoga S1 Memory Upgrades




The Thinkpad Yoga S1 from Lenovo ships with 8GB of RAM already and that’s where it ends for this particular computer as the RAM is soldered on the motherboard meaning that the memory cannot be upgraded in this model.




## Lenovo Thinkpad Yoga S1 SSD Drive Upgrades




The ram on this particular Thinkpad might not be upgradable but the SSD Drive is. This particlar configuration already has a 250GB SSD which is a pretty respectable size but if you do need more storage SSD’s are cheaper than ever now and you could double the size to 500Gb for [about $200](http://amzn.to/2pJy3Rv)
