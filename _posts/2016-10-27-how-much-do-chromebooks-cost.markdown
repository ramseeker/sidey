# Chromebook Prices




Expect to pay about $200 for a cheap Chromebook and about 3 to four hundred dollars for more feature rich models that include a touch screen and in some cases a 360 degree hinge that allows the Chromebook to be used in tablet mode.




Here’s a few suggestions:




## [Acer Chromebook CB3-131-C3SZ](http://amzn.to/2e0jwe6)




This might just be the best deal on a Chromebook. It’s not the cheapest Chromebook you can buy but it does offer pretty good bang for the buck. MSRP is about $175.00 for this small and rugged 11 inch notebook with a sturdy feel and bright IPS display - something that’s not usually included with a Chromebook of this price.  It’s not the fastest Chromebook you can buy but it’s more than usable for everyday tasks.




## [ASUS C201 C201PA-DS02 11.6 Inch Chromebook](http://amzn.to/2eVfFfO)




This Chromebook is far from the fastest model you can buy with a rockchip processor you might be better off with the Acer Chromebook listed above. It does comw with 4GB of RAM and 16GB of storage though so you will be able to have enough room for some local files as well as being to keep more than a few tabs open at the same time.




## [Acer Chromebook 14, Aluminum, 14-inch Full HD](http://amzn.to/2e0r1S0)




Priced at about $300 this is not the cheapest Chromebook you can buy but it does offer a better build quality than cheaper models and features a full HD IPS display as well as an all-aluminium build. It’s no Apple product, but it’s also only about the third of the cost.




## [Samsung Chromebook 3](http://amzn.to/2e0IWs6)




The Samsung Chromebooks have well been known for their affordablity and the version 3 is the latest revision. If offers a Celeron processor, 4GB of RAM and 16GB of storage. The best part is the price at well under $200.00




## [Acer Chromebook 15](http://amzn.to/2fb1E2H)




Looking for a chromebook with a big screen? The Acer Chromebook 15 is the one and only Chromebook that offers a 15inch FUll HD dispay. It’s also one of the faster chromebooks you can buy too with a faster Celeron processor than the others listed above. The chromebook 15 is big and heavy though - if you are in the market for a small and lighweight Chromebook, then this is not the Chromebook to buy.




## [HP Chromebook 13](http://amzn.to/2fb47Kn)




The HP Chromebook 13 is one of the more expensive Chromebooks you can buy with the higher end models close to $1000 in price. But for about $500 you can buy a Chromebook with a full Quad HD display and much better build quality than the others.




## [Acer Chromebook R11](http://amzn.to/2e0MWZH)




What if you took the Acer Chromebook 11 above, and added a touchscreen with a 360 degree hinge for use in tablet mode? You would get the Acer R11. This is one of the best selling chromebooks thanks to the price/performance ratio. Priced at under $300 you get all the features listed above with all day battery life and 4GB of RAM with 32GB of local storage space.
