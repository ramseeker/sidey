There’s lots of ways to find out what memory you need to buy but the best way to get the right ram for your Mac or PC (or even unix box) is to **use a memory scanner. **Depending on what store you buy memory from, you could be using a memory tool,memory finder, or memory software or memory configurator.




Some memory stores list a million products on their front page with best selling memory lists, best memory upgrade brands, and so on but almost every store offers a memory scanner to help you buy the correct memory. Most memory scanners work the same: You pick the brand, computer type and model and a program spits back of compatible memory upgrades. The scanner also offers a buch of other useful information too like the maximum memory allowed, memory banks available, memory type required and more. But, like all things in life some memory scanners are better than others  so let’s  have a look:




[**Amazon**](http://www.amazon.com/?_encoding=UTF8&tag=ramseeker-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957). Amazon may have the cheapest prices on RAM but you need to know what memory type you need. Sometimes for the Mac Memory you can search for MacBook Pro memory for an example  and you will get some results returned, but to view the entire selection you really should know what ram you need to buy before you visit Amazon. One way to find out the right ram is to read reviews on memory upgrades and check the best selling memory upgrade lists too. If everybody else is buying a particular type of RAM, you can probably do some research and see if the ram that’s selling will work in your Mac or PC.




**[RAMJET](http://www.ramjet.com) **Ramjet has had the exact same website since the mid-nineties and at one time did not have any memory selector tool at all – just links to pages but in recent years they do offer a pull down menu like the others that allow you to choose ram for popular  Macintosh computers. RAMJET does sell PC memory too but their primary focus and sales are for Macintosh memory upgrades. One area for improvement might be in the sorting – they list ram for the oldest models on the top of the page and you have to scroll for newer modeles. I would reverse this.




[**Crucial Technology**](http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1548159-10273954)




Crucial has in some ways almost too much choice when scanning for the right RAM. You can start with their memory configurator, use the memory scanner that scans your PC and reports on ram compatibility. Lastly, you can search for model names and I have goodl luck with that as the search engine usually offers the information I need. When Crucial finds the right ram for your PC you get info on maximum memory, memory type and memory slots available




[**Data Memory Systems **](http://www.datamemorysystems.com)DMS just updated their website and now offers many more memory upgrades than before but you have to work a bit hardter to find them as you have to select type of memory (desktop, notebook etc), memory brand, memory line and  memory model. That’s a lot. But, the good news is once you find the page with your memory upgrade on it , there’s a lot of information including what the original memory is/was  in your specific computer model in addition to the maximum memory, number of memory slots available and memory type.




**[OEMPCWORLD](http://www.oempcworld.com) **is the only other computer memory store besides Crucial Technology that offers both a memory scanner and memory configurator. The configurator works just like all the others and matches your  PC to the memory type but the scanner actually scans your PC for the memory you need. It’s noted that this is a one-time scan that happens and the software doesn’t scan the contents of your hard drive – it’s more interested in your hardware than software. If you prefer to not use this for security or paranoia or both, then you can still use the memory configurator that this store offers.




**Who has the best memory scanner?** If you want to have software actually scan your computer you have to choose between Crucial and OEMPCWORLD and I give the nod to Crucial due to the brand name. If you don’t want to use a system scanner to find the right memory upgrade than you’re using a memory configurator and most offer the basics such as maximum memory, memory type and  number of memory upgrade slots. A few will just match you  up with memory type and leave you on your  own to figure out the maximum ram your PC would run. I would avoid these and the memory stores I list above do a much better job of helping you buy memory for your notebook or desktop PC.
