It's her 15th birthday today (in months) so when she took her bath today she did it without having plonked her into a [laundry tub](https://amzn.to/3cNSu4Z) first.

But without the laundry tub to keep her safe in the tub, she wiggles around on her rear end and thinks that she can move around in the tub just as she can on the carpet and for everybody that's slipped in the bathtub knows: that's not the case!

There were a few close calls today so I thought I would investigate the [best bath mats for toddlers](https://amzn.to/35a27Z6) and a lot of them look [pretty ugly](https://amzn.to/3aM9DuN) - not that matters much, but I think **bath time should be fun** and not boring at all.

I ended up buying the [Skip Hop Moby Non Slip Bath Mat](https://amzn.to/3cSrXn4) in blue for a few reasons: one is that it actually has some color to it and second that it looks well designed. When you're done with it you can hang it up to dry and it looks like it has channels in it for the water to leak out.

Bath Mats can get pretty scrungy really fast so I wanted something that would be washable too and this seems to fit the bill.

What I didn't want to buy were those [bath mat stickers](https://amzn.to/2S6cCre) that get really gross and  then you have to scrape them off with a sticker. ew.

So there you have. Not only do we have lots of [toys](https://jim.am/the-toys/)  we now have a bath mat for the tub.

Hopefully once it arrives there will be no more close calls of slipping in the tub.
