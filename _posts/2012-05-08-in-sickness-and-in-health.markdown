B is sick. Again.




Nothing too serious - just the usual “Jimmy I Feel Like Crap” again that has me stumbling in the dark for Tylenol and water for her in the wee hours (the dog, BTW doesn’t move at all during all this).  Trooper that she is, she’s at work keeping me in the way I’ve been accustomed while I’m home here with the dog. Thank Goodness for DayQuil




I’ve joked that when the ‘officiant’ at our  blessed event was doing the usual ‘sickness and in health’ bit that I didn’t think **she would mean right away** and that we’d get a bit of health first with the sickness coming later in life.




Dear common cold: Go away.
