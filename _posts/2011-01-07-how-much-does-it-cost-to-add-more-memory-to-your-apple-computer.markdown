The short answer:  not much at all. [RAM is cheap](http://www.jim.am) and you should, if you can afford to – max out the RAM on your Apple Computer.




[table id=15 /]MacBook Pro Memory is just one of the most popular Apple upgrades you can buy today.




 




**[Best RAM for Apple Notebooks](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ramseeker-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW)**




The longer answer to this question is: it depends on what computer you want to add more memory to, be it an Apple iMac, Apple MacBook, Apple MacBook Pro or Apple Mac Pro as they all require different memory upgrades depending on what specific Apple Computer you are looking to upgrade.




For this article, we’re going to talk about currently shipping [Apple Computers on sale](ttp://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_ss_c_1_14%26field-keywords%3Dapple%2520computer%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Delectronics%26sprefix%3Dapple%2520computer&tag=ramseeker-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957) and we’ll cover the discontinued Apple computers in the future.




For the Apple iMac it will [cost you as little as $52 for a 4GB memory upgrade](http://www.jim.am/memory/iMac_(DDR3_1333)/) module. Assuming the Apple iMac can accept 16GB , you will need to buy four 4gb memory modules for iMac which would bring your total up to just over $200 at today’s memory prices for Apple iMac




With the professional desktop from Apple – the Apple Mac Pro, this is where it gets really interesting as depending on which current Apple Mac Pro you have you might require DDR3 1066Mhz or DDR3 1333MHz sodimm memory upgrades. And as there’s  lots of room for memory upgrades inside a Mac Pro you could [drop almost $2000 to fill your Mac Pro with memory](http://www.jim.am/memory/Mac_Pro_RAM_Upgrade_Kits_DDR3_1333_with_8GB_RAM/) up to the Maximum 64GB of RAM the latest Mac Pro models can recognize




The tiny desktop Mac, the Mac Mini use DDR3 1066Mhz sodimms and can accept up to 8GB of DDR3 SDRAM so to max out your new Apple Mac Mini you would need to [buy 4GB x 2](http://www.jim.am/memory/Mac_Mini_(1066_DDR3)/) to get the full performance from Apple’s tiniest desktop computer made to date costing you a bit over $100 with two 4GB Mac Mini RAM upgrades




On the notebook side, Both the Apple MacBook and Apple MacBook Pro accept the same type of RAM: The DDR3 SDRAM 1066Mhz sodimms, the difference between the two models being the maximum amounts of memory the two different MacBook models can accept. On the MacBook, 4GB of RAM is the maximum so the [cost would be as little as $50](http://www.jim.am/memory/MacBook_KITS_(1066_DDR3)-4gb/) and for the MacBook Pro’s which can accept up to 8GB of RAM, the cost doubles to just a tad [over $100 to fill your MacBook Pro with the most memory possible](http://www.jim.am/memory/MacBook_KITS_(1066_DDR3)/).
