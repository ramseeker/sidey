The [best prices on RAM](http://www.jim.am). If there is a theme here at ramseeker it is that it’s my goal to help you get the best deal on RAM that you can. Yes, memory has dropped in price in recent times but it still costs money to upgrade your desktop or notebook computer, and in most cases it is your hard earned money you’re spending on RAM so of course you want to find the cheapest RAM price you can find when it comes to ram upgrades for either your notebook or desktop computer, and I can help.

What you need when it comes to shopping for memory upgrades is the right upgrade at the best price. That’s it. It’s nice to shop for name brand memory but it’s not needed unless you’re doing mission critical work with your computer, but for the most of us we’re just surfing the internet, or some other task such as [facebook](http://www.facebook.com) and using generic memory upgrades when shopping for RAM.




Why you want to look out for generic RAM as opposed to name brand memory is that for the most part – save for the little sticker on the ram module, there’s not a whole lot of difference between the two, except the price and it’s always been my policy to list the lowest price available for memory upgrades from the various memory manufacturers or resellers regardless of whether the memory is name brand or generic. If there’s an option, I have always tracked memory prices for generic ram as in most cases, generic memory is cheaper.

Rather than list the lowest ram prices here I will direct you to a page that lists [memory stores](http://www.jim.am/where-to-buy-computer-memory-upgrades/) you can [buy ram ](http://www.jim.am)from and you can make the choice yourself, or you can search for the [cheapest apple memory](http://www.jim.am/#lowest) or [cheapest PC memory](http://www.jim.am/pc/index.php#lowest) too.
