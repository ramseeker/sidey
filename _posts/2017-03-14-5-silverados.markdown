Just five silverados last night at work.




I was hoping to photograph six but  I don’t know where the  time went. The five I did do were parked in what is probably the worst spot on the lot with **no room** at all  so I tend to take it slow and get out a look to make sure I don’t hit another one.




I doubt I’m going to work later today though due to the big winter storm. The commute would be longer than my actual shift. I will now later in the day.
