I am now tracking and monitoring memory upgrade prices for the new Apple MacBook Pro models released today and as I write this there are just two memory stores who ship and stock RAM upgrades for the 2011 Apple MacBook Pros. Seeing as how the new MacBook Pro models were released just a few hours ago that the two memory stores that tend to specialize in Apple memory are the first to announce and list memory prices online for the new Apple MacBook Pro Models, those two memory sellers being [RAMJET](http://www.jim.am/ramjet) and OWC.




[table id=1 /]**Update**: I have added memory prices for MacBook Pro 2011 RAM prices for the newest MacBook Pro models from the the following memory stores: [Crucial Technology,](http://amzn.to/2oA2gjC) [Data Memory Systems](http://www.jim.am/dms) and [MemoryX](http://www.jim.am/memoryx)

I have created two pages for the 2011 MacBook Pro’s as like always over the years if you’re in the market for the best prices on MacBook Pro RAM you need to check for both [4GB MacBook Pro DDR3 Memory Modules](http://www.jim.am/memory/MacBook_Pro_DDR3_1333Mhz_Memory_Upgrades-4gb/) as well as [8GB MacBook Pro Memory Upgrade Kits](http://www.jim.am/memory/MacBook_Pro_DDR3_1333Mhz_Memory_Upgrade_Kits-8gb/) as some stores only ship modules and others carry only the kits so be sure to check both for the best deal on 2011 MacBook Pro Memory Upgrades.




I’m surprised Apple didn’t bump the maximum memory on the 2011 MacBook Pros to a maximum of 16GB as this is what the new Apple iMacs can handle for almost a year now so I really assumed that 16GB of RAM for the MacBook Pros would be the default.




The new DDR3 MacBook Pro RAM for the 2011 MacBook Pros is compatible with the current Apple MacBook Computers and that’s for all versions – 13 inch to 17 inch models.
