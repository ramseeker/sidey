Our little one **LOVES** her rattle ball so I thought I would take the time to research a few that are similar to the one she has in case any other parent wants to find a toy that actually **works** in entertaining their kid.

Here's a few suggestions:

This is the closest to the one that we have and it's only eight bucks [check price](https://amzn.to/2yEYlYx). It's lightweight and thankfully the rattle isn't too loud. It seems to be a hit and it's the [one I suggest](https://amzn.to/2yEYlYx)
