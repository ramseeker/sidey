I just watched my Apple iMac leave the house, sold to some young man on craigslist:

It’s a 2008 model, and I maxed out the RAM and replaced the hard drive with a faster one, but I didn’t really need it and besides: the rule is if something comes in the house then something has to leave and I’m eyeing a new phone so maybe I can get BW to okay that purchase now that I’ve gotten rid of some crap.




I paid about $170 for this with upgrades and sold it for $150.00 so I didn’t pay too much of an Apple tax for this item. It ran surprisingly well for a 9 year old computer but I have others to use so I will survive without this for now.
