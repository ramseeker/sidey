The Apple iMac 2.5GHz Intel Quad-core i5 was first introduced May3, 2011 and represented a significant improvement in processor speed and state of the art connectivity.




The Apple iMac 2.5 GHz i5 shipped with a 32 nm, 64-bit Intel Core i5 “Sandy Bridge” processor with quad cores (4 independent processor cores on a single silicon chip, each with one thread). Each core has a dedicated256k level 2 cache and the processor cores share a single 6 MB level 3 cache It also supports Turbo Boost 2.0 (up to 3.3 GHz) — which “automatically boosts the processor speed based on workload” (that is if an application is only using one of the four cores it will automatically increase the speed of the core in use and turn off the unused cores).

The  i5 quad core was  configured with 4 GB of RAM (1333 MHz PC3-10600 DDR3 SDRAM), a 500 GB (7200 RPM) hard drive, a vertically-mounted slot-loading DVD±R DL “SuperDrive”, and AMD Radeon HD 6750M graphics with 512 MB of dedicated GDDR5 memory.




The Mid-2011 iMac line of which the 2.5 i5 iMac was part also uses the same “edge-to-edge” glass design and “seamless all aluminum enclosure” as the Mid-2010 models that came before them.
