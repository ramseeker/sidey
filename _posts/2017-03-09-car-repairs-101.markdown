Earlier last week BW would see if she could test her parking skills.




The result was a small crack on the lower bumper, some small scuffs and scrapes and a busted washer fluid motor.




The scuffs and cracks we will live with because it’s just a matter of time that the other 3 corners look the same but in Buffalo having a washer motor that works is kind of a big deal. So, I took her car to work and they got us all fixed up for a **surprisingly reasonable price** considering I work at a dealer and it’s been the case in the past that dealer repair prices are not that cheap.




One of the benefits of working at car dealer we have found is that you get the luxury of dropping your car off, going to work and then picking it up without having to arrange drop offs or courtesy rides. It’s a benefit to be sure.
