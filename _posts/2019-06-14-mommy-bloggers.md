The dream: post here every day

The reality: work, take care of child and **get as much sleep as possible**

I know I'm not the first person to have a blog and a newborn and others seem to be able to have kids and blogs so it must be me. The kicker is that I only work about 25 hours a week so one would think I have lots of time to write, yes?

It seems just when I sit down to write **there's a distraction** that prevents me from even getting 100 words down.

Part of this is the way I think: I feel I have to have complete silence and the perfect writing evironment in my home office with the music and the lights just right. Perhaps pre-kid this was possible but now I just make a cup of coffee and do my best to sit hunched over a laptop at the kitchen table for twenty minutes in hopes I can get **something** written.

## Priorities

Part of the problem is me. It's much more fun to screw around with blogging platforms and themes for me than it is to actually write - at least at first. Once I get into the  "zone" I can write well.

I really need to change this. I **want** to write here every day, but I can't seem to get my act together enough to juggle the responsiblities of being a parent **annd** finding time to write.

I'm currently on a simplification kick to get rid of stuff I don't need and focus on the stuff that's important to me -  which of course, is family first.

I just need to prioritize better. So, the clock resets - It's day 1 again.

Let's see what tomorrow brings.
