Title: Another Year and another Fifty Bucks
layout: post
---

This is now the 2nd year for this domain name and I have **zero** regrets coughing up the $54.00 for another year of what is obviously a vanity domain name.

I have been **very** spotty with my writing here as I have yet to learn to prioritize it enough over everything else going on because in addition to other reasons for not writing here - I have a newborn. (actually, she's pushing six months soon. I wonder how much further I can get away with the 'newborn' title)

Anyway, life is busy...yada yada yada.

But I still want to write. And not only do I want to write but I think I would like to be able to make a **career** out of writing one day but I guess it will take me a while and more than a few hundred words here and there to get some income, but I would like to try.

I'm giving myself 7 years. It's been said that you tend to overestimate what you can do in a year and underestimate what you can do in 5 or more and I think that's true. I'm probably the same person I was a year ago but for sure I'm different than I was five years ago.

This won't be easy and there will probably be starts and stops to it as well but I would like to try. A very least, make enough to pay for the domain renewal.
