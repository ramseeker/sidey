All these toys already.

I really don't know where all these come from. Truly. They seem to accumulate overnight..you would think they were rabbits living under our shed (which is a whole other story)

Today was kind of a big day. She managed to pull herself up to the toybox all by herself and starting to pull stuff out. As this was the **first time** that this happend I let it slide. I mean, this is the equivalent of pulling your weight up until you can get your legs under you - that's a lot of work and something that I am sure I could not do.

So, toys.

We have [talking elephants](https://amzn.to/3aF661d), multiples of [stuffed bears](https://amzn.to/3f13Bd0), [toys with suction cups](https://amzn.to/2x9G3BB), [2 tablets](https://amzn.to/3eS8Xak), one [laptop](https://amzn.to/2KM9sFf) and one toy is one where it's a pair and they **talk to each other**. OMG do I want a mute button [on that thing](https://amzn.to/2Y4G2K8).

Despite having all these toys that don't even fill [our toybox](https://amzn.to/2yJxwpr) to maximum capacity she's most iterested in the stuff she can't or shouldn't have like phone charging cords or other dangerous stuff in the house. We've baby-proofed with the outlet plugs and door stops so we're good but if you want to be sure if your home is baby-proofed the **only** way to find out is to let a baby loose and they will let you know in under a minute.

One nice thing about having a bunch of toys is that there was a lot that were forgotten about so it's like Christmas all over. There's also the fact that I **prune** the toybox from time to time and donate the toys we don't need as she's grown out of them or we **just have too many**.

All of the toys you see - and more -  will be gone and forgotten over the years and replaced by an [iPhone](http://apple.com) before I would like so for just today I'm celebrating her toy collection.
