I  have a new strategy when it comes to dealing with BW.




BW says that we (ie: me) have to do something and I reply “In the Spring”




Take today for instance, BW comes downstairs and tells me that the trim in the bathroom needs fixed. Okay, I reply “ In the Spring”




I’ve done this a few times now and I think I have a few reasons:






  1. 


My middle initial is P. As in Procrastination





  2. 


BW seems to be okay with this answer





  3. 


It buys me time. I don’t have to get off the couch.







Also, spring is vague time frame. Spring could be March 21 or June 30th. So depending on how you look at it I have anywhere from six weeks of not doing anything to over 3 months ?




Lastly, I figure I get a break. [My last project ](http://jim.am/2018/01/08/50-shades-of-gray/)came in under budget and ahead of time so I figure that I might as well go with this stall tactic  as far as I can as it seems to be working.




Now all I have to do is get her used to the idea that it’s best to do stuff in the summer.
