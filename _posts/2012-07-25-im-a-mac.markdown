T’was five months before christmas,  

and all through the house,  

there was screaming and crying  

and waving of mouse.




She huffed and she puffed,  

and she blew the house down,  

and I’m very very sure  

they could hear straight across town




The excitement you see,  

was based on this quiz:  

what better OS?  

Mac or PC?




Comments and Accents,  

were needed by B.  

And when the Mac doesn’t work  

she calls upon me.




At that my friends is when  

the story goes south.  

For I made this mistake:  

I opened my mouth.




She just wanted the Mac  

to do what she wants.  

She doesn’t want answers,  

just the comments to work.




I tried and I tried,  

to explain that you can’t  

The Mac doesn’t have bubbles  

and that truly blows.




So now here we are, with the  

Apple Koolaid all drunk  

Steve said it would work,  

but it stinks - like a skunk.




So back we go to the store  

with our heads hung so low  

We bought a Mac,  

but we didn’t know.




Steve said it would be better,  

but Bill left some things out.  

Microsoft Word is not working,  

for B, without doubt.




Now here we sit,  

with our old Dell PC  

it’s old and it crashes,  

but at least it formats




One day they will make  

the PC that truly will please  

but until that day comes,  

I’ll be down on my knees




I’ll pray for a PC  

that does what she wants.  

Then I’ll be fired.  

She’ll need no support




She’ll type and she’ll type  

and all will just work  

and I won’t feel helpless  

like some big old jerk




That I cannot bring her  

what she truly needs,  

not computers or jewelry,  

but just some [hot tea](http://jim.am/a-story-about-tea/).
