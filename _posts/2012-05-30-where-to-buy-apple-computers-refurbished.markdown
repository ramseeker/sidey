These computers are usually returned computers for various reasons that have been inspected by Apple, cleaned and then put back out on sale at a discounted price. If you’re patient and wait for the perfect refurbished Mac to appear you can save money on what essentially may be a brand new Mac.




One way to get a better price or great deal on an Apple computer is to buy a refurbished Apple Computer.




[Apple](http://store.apple.com) of course is an excellent source for refurbished Macs and also other products too from Apple such as refurbished iPads and iPods too.




Examples of refurbished Macs currently available are:




[Apple MacBook Pro 17 inch.](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005CWJ76O/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ramseeker-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B005CWJ76O) Save $200




[Apple MacBook Pro 13.3 inch](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005CWIVYI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ramseeker-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B005CWIVYI) Save $100




[Apple MacBook 15 inch](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005CWJ1DI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ramseeker-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B005CWJ1DI) Save $120.00




**Refurbished iPads




** Another great way to get an iPad deal on an essentially new Apple iPad is to buy refurbishe too, and here’s a few examples of the savings you may expect when compared to the prices of a brand new Apple iPad




[Apple iPad (1st Generation 32GB Wifi)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00365F6EG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ramseeker-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00365F6EG) Save $70.00




[ Apple iPad 2 (32GB Wifi) ](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0047DVWQM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ramseeker-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0047DVWQM)Save $87.00




[ Apple iPad (1st Generation 64GB Wifi)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00365F6G4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ramseeker-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00365F6G4) Save $170.00




As you can see from the few examples above, these are pretty good deals on Apple certified and refurbished products and it’s a great way to save money when buying  Apple computers  as they can be expensive when compared to other PC’s using Windows.




Mac Mall is another source you should  check for deals on Apple products as I find that they offer more selection than even the Apple Store and they tend to offer a deal of some sort too –  something that Apple does not, save for the discounted refurbished price.




Buying refurbished Apple Products is one of the better ways to save on Apple products, regardless of whether you’re in the market for an iPad, or Apple Macintosh computer.
