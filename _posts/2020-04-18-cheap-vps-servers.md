It's kind of amazing to have so much available power with these [VPS](https://www.vps.net/), [servers](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/s/server.htm), [droplets](http://www.digitalocean.com"), [instances](http://cloud.google.com) or whatever you want to call them.

All I know is they are cheap. Back in the Day, I was paying $300 a month to have a dedicated server for my site. And to be honest, the server and the service for the server sucked so it's great to have great service **and prices* compared to what I used to pay.

My server costs 6 bucks a month. That costs the same amount as a Latte at [startbucks](http://www.starbucks.com) costs and I have to tell you I have more than one of those a month (at least, I did - pre COVID-19)

For this six bucks I can setup the server **from my phone** and then actually write posts and publish *from my phone**. Yes, it's a PITA to do it with a small device like a phone but the fact that I even can is pretty neat.

I still only use a **fraction** of my what this server can do. I use it to write my [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) blog posts like this one, and then I 'deploy' it to [firebase hosting](https://firebase.google.com/) where my site is hosted. I  could probably save a step and just host the site on the VULTR server too but my workflow is familiar and it's easier to just have Google host it for me. It costs me about 2 cents a month for firebase hosting so I'm okay with the cost.

Of course, there's so much you can do with a server other than blogging but that's what I'm using mine for. It's also pretty fast for the price. Not as fast as my desktop computer for building this site but pretty close - 2 seconds vs 4 seconds.

Having this server allows me to use **any computer** as dumb terminal pretty much as all the computing is not done on my computer but on this server instead.
Another good thing about this stuff is that it's priced **per hour** so you can fire one up and keep it running forever, or for 10 minutes and you will only get billed for your usage.

I wish I had this when I needed a dedicated server for my site.
