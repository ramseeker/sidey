The MacBook Pro 15” 2.3GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 can accept up to [16GB of RAM](http://amzn.to/2aZ7cc2) via the two memory upgrade slots available on this Apple notebook computer.




You can also install[ 8GB of RAM](http://amzn.to/2aG3Hoc) if you so choose, but I recommend maxing out this MacBook Pro model to the maximum amount and the price difference between 8GB of RAM and 16GB of RAM for this MacBook Pro is only about $25.00 for twice as much ram




The MacBook Pro 15” 2.3GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 requires the use of DDR3 1600Mhz sodimms.
