I don't get it when it comes to Sports Cars and owning one. 

Maybe it's because I live in Buffalo and well, there's snow so they only see about 5 or six months

Maybe it's because I'm old and that's a **loooong** way down to get into it, and even longer to get out of it. 

Maybe because they cost too much and last I checked the speed limit was the same 

Maybe because they tend to be status symbols. 

Maybe because they cost too much 

Maybe because they usually don't hold a lot of stuff (or people)
