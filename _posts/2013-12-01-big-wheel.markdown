BW and I have both grown big wheels around our midsections. Something to do with the panettone I think.




So. We need to get fit, and today was the very first step (literally) towards the goal of fitness.  We had thought about joining the new gym down the road but it’s $250 per for an initiation fee plus $50 a month for monthly fees = a lot of money. On the other hand, running shoes are cheap and there’s some road outside we can run on.




We survived the first day today as I found an app for my phone that promises we’ll be running 5k in just two months. The workout schedule is also three times a week so despite the cold temperatures we have no excuse to why we can’t get in shape and get our butts out the door.




Our  first day was  today we just actually had to do a brisk walk for 1.5 miles so it wasn’t too bad but BW was ready for the end of it: “are we done yet?”.




Tuesday we actually start to run. It’s quite possible we’ll both feel we’ve been hit by the truck above by week’s end but we’ve got to do something. And come springtime, we can use the gym membership fees to go towards his and her bikes for summer bike riding.
