Today B came home from work and **wanted to clean**. Yes, you read that right.




So who am I to complain? And at the end of about an hour or so her ‘closet’ is now much better looking and we’ve got a whole bag of stuff to go to the goodwill.  This is the second time I’ve seen this with my very own eyes so I thought I’d better document this as you never know if this will happen again . ?




**Before The Purge: **

**After The Purge: **

The only downside to this is now she needs some clothes to replace the stuff she never wears with new stuff. I don’t  full understand  but it looks like we have a Target run in our future soon..
