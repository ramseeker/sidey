I’ve never really cared about backgounds for Mac computer much when I was a long time Mac user as my computing style is this: h**ave as many windows open as possible at once so you can’t even see the background**. it helps if you have a lot of ram installed to keep all these windows open.




If I were to change the background  on my Mac it would be to just a simple background like am 18 percent grey. This would allow me to work in Photoshop without  having to worry about the background messing  with me when I was photo editing. I was never a big customizer when it cames to my Mac. I would buy a new Mac notebook every year or so and then get to work.  I wouldn’t  even bother buying Applecare because I have written, it’s just a waste of money. I prefer to self insure my  Apple computers after the first year.




**Mac Backgrounds That Look Great  **




There’s lots of  great looking free backgrounds ready for download though, or you could even stick with the stock one from Lion, Apple’s latest operating system. In recent years this is all I  have done. But this is just one guy’s opinion when it comes to personalizing your Mac and I’m not the be all and end all when it comes to customizing your Mac to your specific taste. Here’s a few of the better places to start  looking for Mac backgrounds that look great.




Mac AppStorm shows us [50 Mac Desktops for Maximum Visual Goodness](http://mac.appstorm.net/roundups/graphics-roundups/50-mac-desktops-for-maximum-visual-goodness/) and according to them it can be a ‘fantastica motivator’.




If the 50 weren’t good enough for you they also offer [another 160](http://mac.appstorm.net/roundups/graphics-roundups/160-original-awesome-mac-desktop-wallpapers/) great looking Mac backgrounds for you to peruse. That should keep you busy for a while. ![:)](http://www.jim.am/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png)
