These computers tend to sell for about $339.00 for a new model and even less for used. The one disadvantage of this particular computer is the hard drive. There’s probably enough ram but replacing the drive with a ssd is a good idea.




250gb SSD drives for the Lenovo Ideapad 310 [sell for about $100](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?ff3=4&toolid=11800&pub=5575019070&campid=5337133045&mpre=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fsch%2Fi.html%3F_from%3DR40%26_trksid%3Dp2047675.m570.l1313.TR7.TRC1.A0.H0.X250GB%2Bssd.TRS1%26_nkw%3D250GB%2Bssd%26_sacat%3D0)




Replace that slow spinning hard drive with a faster ssd and you have  very nice computer for about $450.00
