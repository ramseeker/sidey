I do this a lot. I register a [cool domain name](http://www.jim.am) and then get all excited about the project in the first few hours and then I realize that holy, **this is going to be a lot of work**.

So, I quit. Because I get scared. What if I wasted all that time? What if nobody visits? What if I offer no value?

What. If.

But then I got to thinking: why don't I just write the content that was going to be on the other site on this one. Then I would have all the eggs in one basket, instead of trying to get another site up and running. It's not much of headstart I have here but at least I have this website setup already.

I have read that others have written [5000 posts](https://john.do/5k-posts/) in one year for a brand new site and I have no allusions that I too can do this as I already have my [own goal](https://jim.am/one-million-words/) for writing so I don't need to find an unrealistic goal of five thousand posts a year here too.

But, I'm going to start to write about stuff that **interests me** more because this site is about me first and foremost and and my thoughts -  and about what I see if nothing else.

So I guess is a warning: be prepared for some rambling here. I'm going to start writing about stuff I like. A lot.

You have been warned. :)
