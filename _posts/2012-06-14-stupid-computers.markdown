I’ve spent the last hour or so trying to resurrect this blog. I got an notification that there was an update for my blogging software available and so silly boy,** I downloaded it.  **and kissed Tidy Husband goodbye with the click of a button.  I have spent my blogging hour I allocate to trying to fix said blog.




It’s a good thing I attend the school of hard knocks daily and I’ve actually experienced this before so I had an idea of what to do. And for the site that actually pays the bills, I have a backup plan because we all know it’s not a matter of how your computer will break down - but when.




This is a short one today and probably should not even be one - because today was just a day where the highlight was I have managed to get a bit of work done, feed the dog, walk the dog and sundry other household items.  The benefit of having a blog hardly anybody reads (Hi Dad!) is that you don’t have to be a blogging superhero everyday and today was without a cape to be sure. It was Thursday. The End.




I wonder why that is: some days you feel like on top of the world, you can get the deck painted or a book written or can change the world by noon it  seems  -   yet other days it hurts  to tie your shoes and you even can’t do that right it I guess if every day were wonderful or worse, horrible then  it would be no fun. It’s the variety  that keeps us on our toes .




Noteveryday we do something interesting enough to share with the world, like[ walk around with a box on their head. ](http://jim.am/to-venus-and-back/)




I’m going to go read a book.  ?
