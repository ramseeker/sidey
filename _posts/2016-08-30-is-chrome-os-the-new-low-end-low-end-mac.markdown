[Is Chrome OS the New Low End?](http://lowendmac.com/2016/is-chrome-os-the-new-low-end/)




Dan Knight on Chrome OS:




<blockquote>

> Chrome OS is aimed at the low end of the personal computing market. It’s designed so most of your work is done online using your browser with your documents stored on Google’s servers. That reduces the amount of storage a Chrome computer needs. And since 3D gaming isn’t part of the target market, manufacturers don’t need to use expensive GPUs to provide a good user experience.

I have completely switched to Chrome OS and I don’t miss the Mac and it’s high prices.
