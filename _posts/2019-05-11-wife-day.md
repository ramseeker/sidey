It's wife day here. 

Well, technically it's the [3rd Sunday in September ](https://nationaldaycalendar.com/wife-appreciation-day-third-sunday-in-september/) I prefer to change the date, well.. because. 

When we were trying to conceive - and failing miserably - Mothers Day was a bit of a downer here. So..one night on the way home from work I decided from here on in that the **day before mothers day** should be know as wife day. 

And the tradition has stuck. We don't celebrate with cards or flowers but there's usually some treat or some kind. Usually it's dessert of some kind but today it's pancakes for breakfast and a good sleep in while I take care of the [queen](https://jim.am/shes-here/)

If you have a wife, and don't want to go with the masses you can always use this date instead of the official one. I think it's a better fit to have it the day before. But hey, that's me.
