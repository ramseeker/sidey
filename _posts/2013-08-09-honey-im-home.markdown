The bachelor party for the dog and I is now officially over.




**She’s home, and it’s great.** The dog was a little indifferent, which is surprising. I thought the dog would be bouncing up and down like tigger but nope. But at about 3pm yesterday the **unwashed car** (you know who you are) rolled into the garage and BW bounced out.




The first thing I noticed was a: she got a haircut, and b: she smelled like laundry softener. I don’t know what they wash their clothes with in paraguay but there’s no lack of fabric softener. Ever walk into a soap store and think to yourself: how do they work in here? It smells so strong! - well, welcome to our house. I feel like I’m living in some strange world made up of soap and candy floss.




After getting the car unloaded (**did I mention it came back unwashed?**), and BW unpacked and sorted out, we buzzed over to our favorite vietnamese restaurant where the waitress knows us by sight and celebrated with eggplant and soup.




We came back, fed the dog and then at 6pm - BW went to bed.




Not only did BW bring me back a T-shirt, but she also brought a cold all the way from Paraguay with her too. So after a 14 hour flight, six hours of sleep  and a six hour drive she deserves a little 14 hour nap and I didn’t see her to the next morning.




Meanwhile, back in the rest of the house due to all the excitement and unpacking I don’t think the dog got let out. She wasn’t out for a few hours before BW showed up, and then when BW went to bed the dog followed.  This means the dog had not peed in sometime.




Usually, the dog is pretty good at letting us know OMG, LET ME OUT KNOW!, but I  guess with all the excitement and the change in the routine all parties in the household  dropped the ball and the dog dropped the contents  of its bladder on the kitchen floor. I found this out by walking across an unusually wet kitchen floor in sock feet. It’s a lovely sensation.




To summarize:






  * 


BW is home, but with  a cold and smelling  like a soap factory.





  * 


The dog peed on the floor.





  * 


**The car didn’t get washed.**





  * 


And I couldn’t be happier.







Welcome Home, BW. We missed you. (ps, we’re almost out of pizzas and dog food)
