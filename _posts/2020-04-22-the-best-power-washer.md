I bought a cheap power washer today for a few reasons:

1. I had the $60
2. I had the time
3. It's spring. Time to wash the winter away.

I didn't want to spend a lot of money on a powerwasher as I don't **really** have much of a need for it save for the odd household task like washing cars and bikes and hosing off the deck every now and again.

This is the [power washer I bought](https://amzn.to/2VuqIVz)

It's....fine. It's not the most powerful power washer one can buy but I also bought it refurbished for $60.00, so for the price it does the trick.

I've had better luck in the past when buying refurbished. This looked used vs refurbished and had dirt and marks from the previous owner but it's only get dirty anyway, so whatever. It's a tool.

It only hit a high of about 40 degrees here so I didn't spend a whole lot of time with this thing today but it seems to work well for what it does. I did a very quick job in the driveway to see if I can't get an oil leak gone from the concrete driveway and I may be able to after a few passes.

I have a few projects for this once it warms up including giving our [free playhouse](http://127.0.0.1:4000/the-playhouse/) a good cleaning as well as giving our garage a good hose down.

Then there's the cars to clean and the deck and the windows ....

BW better not see this post. She will get ideas. :P
