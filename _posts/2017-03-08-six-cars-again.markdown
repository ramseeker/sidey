This is the third day in a row I have managed to just photograph six cars at work and today’s efforts were:




2014 Chevrolet Tahoe




2011 Nissan Rogue




2013 Dodge Journey




2017 Chevrolet Volt x3




The volt is a nice car. It’s bigger like a ‘real car’ might be as opposed to some of the others. It’s not cheap though at 35K for the one with leather seats and all the creature comforts. Also, it does feel weird driving a car that makes no sound at all.




In other news, BW is still celebrating women’s day and it’s my job to mop the dog prints off the floor.
