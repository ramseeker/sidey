What do you get when you combine the best selling Apple MacBook with the most RAM or memory you can install in a current shipping MacBook Pro? A small, powerful – and thanks in part to the 8GB of RAM that maxes out the 13.3 inch MacBook Pro – notebook computer from Apple that has the most ram possible installed and in most cases, for less than $100 for MacBook Pro 8GB

You can even offset the the cost of 8GB MacBook Pro RAM by selling your old, or original memory that came installed in the MacBook Pro 13 inch back to [some](http://www.jim.am/oempcworld) [memory](http://www.jim.am/ramjet) [manufacturers](http://www.jim.am/memoryx) who will take your older memory in as a trade where you offset the cost and get 8GB RAM for MacBook Pro even cheaper than you could if you bought the RAM




To max out the 13 inch MBP, you need to remove (in most cases) the 2 x 2GB memory modules in the two memory upgrade slots and replace them with 2x 4GB RAM for MacBook Pro. There’s quite a selection of best memory stores (see sidebar) to buy MacBook RAM from but to get the best price you should compare prices on both 4GB memory modules for MacBook Pro and also 8GB memory upgrade kits too as some stores only market their memory upgrades as ram modules, while others prefer to sell you a 8GB MacBook RAM Upgrade KIT which consists of two 4GB DDR3 1066 SDRAM memory modules for MacBook Pro




Stores I recommend for memory upgrades are [Crucial](http://amzn.to/2oA2gjC), [OWC](http://www.jim.am/OWC), [Data Memory Systems](http://www.jim.am/dms), [18004Memory](http://www.jim.am/1800), [MemoryX](http://www.jim.am/memoryx) and [OEMPCWORLD](http://www.jim.am/oempcworld)




There’s other memory stores but over the 14 yeas of tracking memory upgrades I find that these few stores support and sell quality Apple Memory Upgrades for less than what you would pay if you were to buy the RAM from Apple, which while convenient sometimes – is not the best way to save money on ram upgrades.
