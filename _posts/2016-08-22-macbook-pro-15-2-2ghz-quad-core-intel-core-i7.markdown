The MacBook Pro 15‚Äù 2.2GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 can accept up to [16GB of RAM](http://amzn.to/2aZ7cc2) via the 2 memory upgrade slots available on this Apple notebook computer.




If you prefer you can upgrade to half the memory [to just 8GB](http://amzn.to/2aG3Hoc), but with RAM so cheap these days and considering **how much you paid for your MacBook Pro** you might as well max out the ram to 16GB




When shopping for memory for the 15 inch 2.2Ghz i7 MacBook Pro be sure to buy ddr3 1600Mhz sodimms.




Brands that I recommend for this particular MacBook Pro are available from:




[Crucial](http://amzn.to/2bccVIB)




[OWC](http://amzn.to/2bcd4fi)




[Corsair](http://amzn.to/2bccVsr)




[MemoryX](http://memoryx.net)
