I didn’t really think I would be writing about [BW’s cardboard box again](http://jim.am/2018/02/11/the-100-cardboard-box/), but here I am.

See that blank space under the sign where the **box is supposed to go?**




The box **was **there when BW left work.




And then when she came back today it was gone.




It turns out the cleaning staff took and then **recycled her $100 recycling box. ** Essentially it went into the black hole of recycling boxes.




This is not good. Because: $100. That’s a lot of pies.




BW went and found the sanitation people and it turns out that yes, the box got recycled and yes it’s now cut up into tiny pieces. And yes, she’s hosed.




BW did manage to find the part of the box with the pre-paid fedex return sticker on it and the plastic bag that was in the garbage and with some tape and markers managed to make a new box so she can continue her recycling hobby.




All this to save candy wrappers from the landfill. Next time you think about tossing that gum wrapper think about all the hard work BW is doing to try and save the little fellas.




I laughed and and laughed today when BW told me this story because I thought something like this might happen, and sure enough it did.




I’m hoping I don’t have to write about this box again, but with BW - you just never know. ?
