I bought a [new lawnmower today.](https://amzn.to/2VZPxcj)

I know, exciting.

I had a $300 budget for one and I came in at just a dollar over due to taxes. Our current mower has been going great for sometime, but - it's time. I have replaced more than one power switch on the thing and there comes a point where you don't want to spend any more on a old electric mower.

So new mower. Exciting.

Actually, it is kind of exciting. This will be the 3rd mower I will have had in the past 8 years:

The first one **came with the house**! I don't think it's ever a good idea for a mower to be included with the house as chances are **the thing isn't worth moving** and with this one, I think this was the case. It met it's death due to the fact the steering broke and I ran into a fence with it.

My current mower is a cheapo electric job I have had for about 5 years so for the [price I paid](https://amzn.to/2WrCXkO) it has served us well. The breakdown for this one seems to be wheels that wobble, and the safety switch that turns off the mower stopped working last fall and that's the nail in the coffin for it. It could be fixed for about $40, but then there's still the wheels, and dull blade and it's corded.

I don't really mind using a corded mower. The trick is to mow away fromt the outlet. Once you have that figured out you are golden.

The new mower seems...fine. It's battery powered so might be a little quieter which would be nice as I like to listen to podcasts while I am sweltering under the summer sun. The battery seems to be most of the cost as the rest of it looks like what you pay for - lots of plastic. But at $300, it's stil a lot cheaper than a riding mower which we don't need and a **lot** cheaper than than having someone come and mow the lawn once a week so there's that.

I also get a bit of exercise with this push mower so that's always a good thing - especially this spring with the COVID lockdown where it seems that if I walk across the room it's considered 'exercise' by my fitness app. I know I pushed my old mower around today and I'm feeling it. I hope this new mower isn't all that heavy.

If I never had to mow a lawn again I would be good with that, and the time will eventually come for that but for now there's worse things to do than get a bit of exercise mowing the lawn?
