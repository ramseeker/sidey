I’m always looking for ways to speed up my sites and this looks like an easier way than with other plugins. Also, it’s built by Cloudways which hosts this site so  I don’t have to worry about compatibility with my host.




<blockquote>Cloudways WordPress cache plugin Breeze is not only easy to setup and 100% compatible, but it is also completely free for all.
