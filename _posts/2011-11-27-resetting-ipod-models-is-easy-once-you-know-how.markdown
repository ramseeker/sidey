The **[Apple iPod](http://www.amazon.com/mn/search/?_encoding=UTF8&x=0&tag=ramseeker-20&linkCode=ur2&y=0&camp=1789&creative=390957&field-keywords=ipod&url=search-alias%3Daps)** has been around for a while now and with that are different versions. Truth be told, I have an old school 30GB iPod that holds more than enough music I care to listen  to, but it’s starting to get older and I am hoping to buy a new iPod – from Amazon probably as I find that they usually have the**[ best iPod prices](http://www.amazon.com/mn/search/?_encoding=UTF8&x=0&tag=ramseeker-20&linkCode=ur2&y=0&camp=1789&creative=390957&field-keywords=ipod&url=search-alias%3Daps)**, when you compare iPod prices from them as opposed to buying an iPod direct from Apple.




And this means I will want to get rid of my [old iPod](http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/ipod/specs/ipod-5th-generation-enhanced-specs.html) to help pay for the newer model. I am thinking about buying an Apple iPod Touch to replace my much older 30GB model, and I want to be able to reset the 30GB iPod to the same as it was when you bought it back in 2006, almost six years old  now. Wow.




I found an [Apple help document](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1320)  that shows me how to reset my 30GB iPod but  also for others too, so I thought I would share this, as I thought surely there’s somebody else wanting to set their iPod to factory settings.




In my case, all I needed to do was was toggle the hold switch, which means  turning the hold switch on and off and then at the same time I held down the menu button and the center button and in about 7 seconds the iPod reset itself. Apple suggests doing all this with your iPod either plugged into a computer or wall outlet, so I made sure it had power before I went ahead with my iPod reset.




When I was done,  I had a like new 30GB iPod on sale and with the money I got, (not much – well under $100) I could use that money to**[ buy my new Apple iPod Touch](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FA1O0O/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ramseeker-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001FA1O0O)**
