I’m still plunking away on my 2008 MacBook Pro and one thought I had to squeeze a few more months out of it until I saw what the 2012 MacBook Pro notebooks looked like would be to install a [MacBook Pro SSD drive](http://www.jim.am/best-ssd-hard-drives-for-2011/) into this aging MacBook Pro of mine to squeeze a tad more life out of what I’ve already got and have paid for.

A MacBook Pro SSD drive shouldn’t cost more than $200 or so and I’ve found that 128GB SSD’s are priced at about $200 which is the price point I want to be at. The 64GB SSD’s are the cheapest SSD drives for MacBook Pro you can buy but they’re not the largest and by the time you install an OS on them there’s not a lot of room left for my files and music.




Ultimately, I would love a 500GB SSD drive that would allow me enough room for my entire music collection to be stored on the SSD, but the costs for 500GB or even 250GB is still pretty pricey , especially considering I want to install an SSD in an older Mac, I don’t think this is the best money spent.




**Cheap MacBook Pro SSD Drives **




Not that I do a lot of shopping for computer upgrades, but when I  do the first place I check is at Amazon as I have found that for most items, whether it’s solid state drives for MacBook Pro or even a brand new MacBook Pro, it’s hard to beat them when it comes to price and the cheapest SSD drives for both Apple and PC are  on sale at Amazon for a much better price than anywhere else.

Take the Crucial 128GB M4 sSD drive. This drive is on sale at Amazon and cheaper than you can buy the exact same solid state drive at Crucial, and it’s also the best selling SSD drive del at Amazon.

There are other brands offering SSD’s for MacBook Pro  if Crucial doesn’t do it for you such as Kingston and Patriot offers ings and they may even be a few bucks cheaper than the Crucial Brand but over the years I have trusted the Crucial Brand when it comes to buying ram for MacBook Pro so I doubt I would have any problem when it comes to buying Crucial SSD’s on sale.




If you want to browse the best selling SSD drives you’re welcome to but I am going to buy a Crucial SSD for my MacBook Pro.
