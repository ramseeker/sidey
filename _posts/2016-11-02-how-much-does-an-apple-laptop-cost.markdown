## Apple Laptops are Not Cheap.




If you are looking for a cheap laptop, consider a [Chromebook](http://amzn.to/2enBBTn) or [Windows PC](http://amzn.to/2f0V9ey). But if you are an Apple faithful for whatever reason expect to pay between $900 for a [refurbished MacBook](http://amzn.to/2enwMtq) to over four thousand dollars for [more expensive configurations](http://amzn.to/2enwMtq)




## Current Apple Laptop Prices




### Apple MacBook






  * 


Apple MacBook 1.1GHz 8GB of RAM and 256GB SSD storage - $1299.00





  * 


Apple MacBook 1.2GHz 8GB of RAM and 512GB SSD storage - $1599.00







### Apple MacBook Air






  * 


13 inch MacBook Air 1.6Ghz 8GB of RAM and 128GB SSD storage - $999.00





  * 


13 inch MacBook Air 1.6Ghz 8GB of RAM and 256GB SSD storage - $1199.00







### MacBook Pro






  * 


13 inch MacBook Pro 2.0Ghz 8GB of RAM and 256GB SSD storage - $1499.00





  * 


13 inch MacBook Pro 2.9Ghz 8GB of RAM and 256GB SSD storage - $1799.00

  * 


15 inch MacBook Pro 2.7Ghz 16GB of RAM and 512GB SSD storage - $2799.00







If you start to add more like RAM, or bigger storage or faster processors you’re looking at close to $3000 or more for a maxed out MacBook Pro in 2016.




# What MacBook to Buy?




I can’t really say because we each have different needs. My usage is web based so I can even get away with an iPad for writing if I had to or a ChromeBook but if it were me I would probably look at either a [refurbished 2015 MacBook](http://amzn.to/2enwMtq) or if I wanted to splash all out - the entry level MacBook Pro. I don’t need the touchbar, as neat as it does look to be.
