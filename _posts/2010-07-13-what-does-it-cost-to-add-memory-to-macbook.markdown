** It does not cost a  lot  of money  to add ram to a MacBook.**




**[![Best Selling Apple Laptop](http://www.jim.am/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-8.27.38-PM.png)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ramseeker-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I)**




**[MacBook Pro is the Best Selling MacBook](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ramseeker-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I)**




In fact, the cost is so low these days, that ram prices and comparing ram prices over time you will find that the price to add ram to MacBook is so very cheap that it doesn’t make sense not to add ram to your MacBook, or MacBook pro or any other portable apple computer you have or thinking of  buying.




When you buy a MacBook or MacBook Pro from Apple, or Amazon, or MacMall, or wherever else you want to buy an apple computer from you should always upgrade your MacBook or MacBook pro ram and memory to the maximum amout of memory  you possibly can, or in some cases, afford to.




If you can afford to upgrade your memory, why not do it in a way that makes sense? Don’t buy the first memory upgrade you see. Yes, you might be able to buy memory from your MacBook pro or MacBook right from  apple, but when you buy memory from apple, the ram is very expensive and you can buy cheaper ram from other  online memory stores for much less money than what you would spend if you bought the same memory from anywhere else, including the Apple Store.




If you need to[ buy ram for any apple computer](http://www.jim.am), I suggest go check ram prices as they change daily sometimes. The good news is ram prices have dropped over time and you can still get some really good deals on ram for less than what you would pay if you bought your memory from the Apple Store, or Costco, or even Walmart. And do you really want to buy your memory  from Apple? Apple is interested in one thing and that’s profit. Don’t let the apple koolaid get to you –  they are in business to make as much money as possible and will continue to do so over the years.




But  if you buy ram from some memory stores that specialize in Apple Memory and yet still  allow you  to get the best price you can on memory upgrades that meet Apple’s high standards.




It doesn’t cost much to upgrade the MacBook or MacBook Pro’s with the most RAM possible. You will be glad you did upgrade your computer as your computer will run faster  and will crash, well never. It’s a Mac. Fill it with memory and forget about what the costs of ram upgrades are until you are ready to buy memory again.
