<blockquote>[![](https://jim.am/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/screenshot-1.png)](http://themnific.com/theme/enhanced-2016/)      If you are WordPress user (website owner) you probably know core and free Twenty Sixteen theme. Nice looking and good theme. Isn’t it? But bit boring… We decided to pack some cool features into a child theme (Magazine Builder™), so you can add great magazine “stuff” to your WordPress blogging site now …

This looks to be a very nice theme that’s **free** and would be good to use for both a personal site or magazine. I like the look better than the [twenty-seventeen](https://jim.am/2017/07/06/featured-free-wordpress-themes/)
