I am not 100 percent sure, but I think that we have the virus at our house. Of course, we are not certain because [the county](https://www2.erie.gov/health/coronavirus) does not have any tests for us to well, test. 

That means that all we can do is guess.  BW has it the worse with a high fever. So high, in fact that our doctor referred her to  the emergency room to get looked at  but again - no tests, they are  not sure -  but the diagnosis was "supposed coronavirus".  

It looks like she has begun to overcome it though and with some Tylenol has been on the mend. 

For your  truly, I have had a dry cough, but no fever, so who knows.  

The little one, thankfully is fine. :) 

This is hard. Not only are we cooped up with each other and over the course of the day I have been the primary caregiver (which I don’t really mind all that much ) but we have the news AND EVERY DAY  the news has gotten worse. For our area we are not to see the worst of it until later in the month. 

This is not a complaint. It is what it is and we are doing the best we can to cope and nobody in the house is **extremely** sick which is **very good news** 

Also, we have toilet paper. (But not too much)

It’s a different time, to be sure. I hope the  future will get better  but I fear after this pandemic things won’t be the same. 

Be safe out there.
