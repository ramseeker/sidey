It’s Wednesday.




That’s the middle of the week and if your house is like ours, **it’s clean** - ish. Heavy on the ish. It’s not horrible by any stretch but I would be lying to you if I told you our home was showroom ready.




As an example, as I write this there is an empty laundry hamper smack dab in the middle of the living room. I’m not sure how it got there or even who put it there in the first place - but it’s been there long enough that the dog hair is starting to drift up against the edges.




I saw this hamper a day or so ago and my first thought was to just pick it up and put it somewhere more appropriate than in the middle of the living room . But then I wondered how long it would stay there before somebody, anybody would move it?




It turns out that a laundry hamper can make it to mid week - **at least ** - the week is still young.




This empty  laundry  hamper can also mean two things:






  1. 


All our laundry is done and put away so we have no more laundry for it to hamp.





  2. 


or…we haven’t done laundry in so long we even forget what this thing is in our living room and this is the first piece that started our new hoarding hobby.







I really, really hope it’s number 1.
