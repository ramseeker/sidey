I guess it had to happen eventually.




Because we have a pretty big driveway, we pay a “snow plow guy” to come plow our driveway out after the storms each winter.




Every fall we send him a check and every fall he comes and stick little sticks in the ground so he can see where the driveway is when it’s  buried under a foot or so of snow.




He does a good job with these. This year, they were white plastic conduit that the ends painted bright orange so that nobody will back into them when they back their car out of the driveway.




And every year it doesn’t matter what color they are - somebody **always **backs up over one.




This year it was my turn.




After realizing that I had backed over the stupid thing I pulled forward and popped out to take a look and I could see that the stick/post was sticking out from under the car.  “No problem” I thought - I will just pull and the stick will come out  and I will be on my way.




Well…no.

It seems that by pulling  the car forward, I managed to jam this stupid stick so far up the rear end of the car it was never coming out.




I managed to get most of the stick out, but the little orange end was still stuck way up there.




Not  much I could do at this point so I just got in my car and drove to work.




When I got to work I crawled under and  the little orange end had fallen out. There - problem  solved - right?




Well….no.




Now I have a squeaky rear end ( the car, not me) but I am not sure if this sound was there before  this incident or if this is a result of my adventure.




I’m tempted to just turn up the radio because it’s a 10 year old car and all older cars squeek but I will probably end taking it  into the shop soon just to be sure.




When I texted  BW this morning I backed into the post her reply was:




“Hahahahahahahahahahahaha”




At least I didn’t take out the mailbox.
