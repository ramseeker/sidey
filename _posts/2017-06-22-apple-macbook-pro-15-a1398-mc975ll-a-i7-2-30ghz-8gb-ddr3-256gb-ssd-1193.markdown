This computer tends to sell for about $550.00




This might not be the best example of a MacBook Pro as far as condition  but it does some things going for it as you don’t need to really upgrade the RAM or the hard drive because it’s already been done - saving you some money.




The only upgrades you would need for this  computer would be to [add a new battery ](http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2047675.m570.l1313.TR0.TRC0.H0.XMC975LL%2Fa+battery.TRS0&_nkw=MC975LL%2Fa+battery&_sacat=0)




If you total the cost of those two you would have a fast 2012 MacBook Pro for about $600.00
