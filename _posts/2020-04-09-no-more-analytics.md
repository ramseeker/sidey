I don't care that you visit.

Wait, that's not what I mean. It means I don't **count** your visit, and yes there is a difference.

It's also one less thing to 'check'. Ever since I finally realized that this site is for me and for fun more than finance I actually write.

One would think that this would mean more site visitors over time and that I would wan to **count that**, but meh. I will count [words written](http://jim.am/one-million-words) rather than visitors as lately it has much more value to me.
Lastly, with no cookies on this site I don't have put one of those **we use cookies** warnings on this site. If there's no trackers and no cookies there's nothing to warn you about.

And I found that if I track the pages you visit I find that I "chase the dragon" and only write about more stuff that's popular instead of writing about other topics and exploring more stuff to write about.

And that's no fun.
