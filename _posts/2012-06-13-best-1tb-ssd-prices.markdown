1TB SSD Prices are still in the stratosphere for the time being, but over time we will see the prices for 1 TB ssd drives drop, just like we have seen the prices for 1TB hard drives drop over the years. But I suggest while you wait for the prices for 1TB SSD’s to come down to earth, **[check out hard drives that are known as hybrid drives](http://www.amazon.com/mn/search/?_encoding=UTF8&tag=ramseeker-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957&field-keywords=hybrid%20drive&url=search-alias%3Daps)**




Consider the cost of a brand new SSD drive will set you back close to $2500 (if not more, as you can see from some of the best prices I found for 1TB SSD prices currently for a solid state drive with that much capacity. But what if you could get real close to the performance of an SSD for a fraction of that? You’d be all over it, right? I know I was an that’s why I upgraded my MacBook Pro with a hybrid SSD drive as opposed to buying a SSD. I think I paid a little over $100 for my Seagate Hybrid drive and it works great because after a while it remembers your most accessed data for faster hard drive performance when compared to standard hard drives, but at a fraction of the SSD costs.




If you’re buying a 64GB SSD or even a 128GB SSD you may not care about the hybrid drives as the realSSD prices may be cheaper than a hybrid drive anyway, but for the 1TB size for Solid State Drives, I think you’d be better to spend your money elsewhere. At the prices the Solid State hard drives are demanding for 1TB you could buy a few, if not many computers for the same price.
