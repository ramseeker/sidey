Today was our lucky day. Despite all the [coronavirus](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)
 bad news we are still people at heart, and as luck would have it this was in our future today.


 We were out for a family walk around the block when we saw our neighbor aroudn the corner
 dragging this playhouse to the curb. We stopped and talked to him and he said it was ours
 if we wanted it.

 The trouble was, there was no way we could get it home. "No problem" he said and he tossed it in
 his pickup truck and delivered it to our house while we finished our walk around the block and when
 we returned there was a plastic playhouse in our driveway.

 We managed to place it next to our platic shed as the foundation from our old shed was still there
 so it's a nice solid footing for her new playhouse. All it needs is a good cleaning and it's a little
 faded by the sun but we don't care as it would get faded anyway over time.

 This is a great deal (hard to beat free) as this would have cost us [about](https://amzn.to/34ctukS) $200 new.

 She might not get much use out of it this year as she's still a little one but perhaps the summer
 of 2021 will be a better time for all the world to play anyway.
