Perfect for father’s day or a graduation present, the [Dell Inspiron 15R N5010](http://www.jdoqocy.com/click-1548159-10550055?url=http%3A%2F%2Flt.dell.com%2Flt%2Flt.aspx%3FACD%3D%25za-%25zp-%25zs%26AID%3D%25zp%26CID%3D24471%26LID%3D566643%26DGC%3DCJ%26DGSeg%3DDHS%26DURL%3DHTTP%3A%2F%2Fconfigure.us.dell.com%2Fdellstore%2Fconfig.aspx%3Foc%3Dfncor05%2526cs%3D19%2526c%3DUS%2526l%3DEN%2526m_29%3DFQ1O&cjsku=FNCOR05_1) is the first generation 15R notebook from Dell and is not to be confused with newer and obviously faster Dell Inspiron 15R that features Intel Core processors and offers a faster computing experience than the older, but cheaper Dell 15R.




But for everyday computing, this **fast dell notebook** with a market value of $519.99, but on sale today for $449.00 is more than enough computer for those that don’t want to scrimp on screen size but don’t want to pay over $500 for a notebook computer with a 15 inch LCD display.




Because you’re ordering a new computer from Dell, you can customize the [Dell Inspiron 15R N5010](http://www.jdoqocy.com/click-1548159-10550055?url=http%3A%2F%2Flt.dell.com%2Flt%2Flt.aspx%3FACD%3D%25za-%25zp-%25zs%26AID%3D%25zp%26CID%3D24471%26LID%3D566643%26DGC%3DCJ%26DGSeg%3DDHS%26DURL%3DHTTP%3A%2F%2Fconfigure.us.dell.com%2Fdellstore%2Fconfig.aspx%3Foc%3Dfncor05%2526cs%3D19%2526c%3DUS%2526l%3DEN%2526m_29%3DFQ1O&cjsku=FNCOR05_1) to your heart’s content and buy not only the notebook but add anti virus software, upgrade the processor from Intel Core i3 to Intel Core i5 and select bigger hard drive and memory options but you’re better off buying the RAM for your Dell Inspiron 15R online and installing the memory yourself. **Why? You’ll save money on RAM this way**.![Dell Inspiron 15R Laptop Computer](http://i.dell.com/das/dih.ashx/314x314/images/global/products/314x314/inspiron-15r-right-black-alternate-314.jpg)




Dell Inspiron 15R N5010 notebooks, regardless of what hard drive, software and other notebook accessories you end up buying and adding to your dell shopping cart all use the same type of memory, and that’s DDR3 1333Mhz sodimms and by replacing the factory installed ram using two **[4GB DDR3 SDRAM sodimms](http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&cjsku=CT51264BC1339)** or even better: **[buy an 8GB Memory Upgrade Kit for the Dell Inspiron 15R](http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&cjsku=CT51264BC1339)**and have the most memory you can possibly install into the Dell Inspiron 15R N51010 for much less than what Dell will charge you for memory upgrades for this particular notebook computer, and at time of writing this, this works about to paying half price for the RAM for your Dell notebook, as there’s a very good chance if you buy a Dell notebook in 2011 you’ll need **[8GB Memory Upgrade Kits](http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&cjsku=CT51264BC1339)** to max out the ram on all Dell Notebook Models.
