I put her in this tonight to go to bed as we have the air conditioning on and it can get a bit cool. She can't use blankets in the [crib](https://amzn.to/2GS2mgR) yet but she can wear little sleepers and these cotton gown sleepers are just the right weight for sleeping at room temperatue and they are not too hot compared to some [fleece speepers](https://amzn.to/31fIT1g) we have.

The long sleeves are nice on nights like this as it keeps her little arms warm and then the elastic bottom keeps feet tucked in and wrapped up as they should be.

These go for about five dollars each so you can't really go wrong with the price.
