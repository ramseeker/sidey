RAM prices drop over time. They just do. Especially for the latest and greatest memory for your apple, dell, sony or toshiba as these days all computer brands use the same memory types and sizes but over time ram prices drop:




Here’s an example for iMac Memory:




[![imac ram prices get cheaper](http://www.jim.am/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2010-08-09-at-4.33.42-PM.png)](http://www.jim.am/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2010-08-09-at-4.33.42-PM.png)




Wild eh? (there’s my canadian showing). The iMac RAM (this particular graph is from 2008 data) dropped from $90 to $40 over the period of the year. That’s a resonable savings over the price of the year.




Can you afford to wait for ram prices to drop? Let’s pretend you make your living with your iMac, or any computer it doesn’t matter but you make money online with your computer. Maybe you’re a photographer who uses photoshop or a writer or maybe you just blog and hope to make a few bucks here and there.. it doesn’t really matter what computer you use or what you do to make money with your computer: my question to you is : what’s it worth to you to wait until ram prices drop?




About a year ago you would have to pay about 1000 dollars to upgrade your iMac to the maximum at the time. The Mac web went crazy! ‘what – they cried – that’s almost the sam price as the iMac!’ What they didn’t realize that for some, even at $1000 for memory upgrades was still the bargain of the year.  If you’re making money with your computer either offline or  online it doesn’t matter the $1000 is the biggest bargain for memory if it means more work getting done easier and smoother.




A lot of people think that the lowest price on ram is so important, but if you make more than that with your skills, your computer and your maxed out memory  the price of the upgrade is really not an issue, especially when you amortize the ram costs over the time you own your computer. I’ve worked it out in other posts, but the ram for my MacBook Pro works out to about $4 a month. Pretty cheap ram if you ask me.




Granted, you could wait for ram prices to drop and as you see in the image above they do – and usually the ram prices drop pretty fast for newer models as more and more memory gets manufactured and  there’s more places to [buy ram and memory](http://www.jim.am) for your new computer it only makes sense that demand will grow and prices will drop.




The question really is: Can you afford to wait for ram prices to drop, and not [when will ram prices come down](http://www.jim.am/pc/)?
