![blown](/images/blown.jpg)

I'm usually more careful than this. But not this time. 

I blew a speaker. You see, I have a small little home office in a corner of the
basement next to the **washing machine** so, ya...It's glamorous. 

Anyway, in this little office of mine I have a few stereo speakers that are worth next to nothing now that they are
20 years old as a music source. Well, somehow before switching inputs I forgot to turn off the amplifier and **boom**
blown speakers. 

Of the 4, I blew 2. So 50 percent. 

They are not **blown** per se and sound more like pfffffff...pffffft...pffft. 

But the good news is you can fix them, I think. 

I have ordered a [speaker foam repair kit](https://amzn.to/2RJSyux) that should be here next week so I will be able
to see if I can fix these on my own. If I can - it will be $20 well spent for the  kit, but if I screw it up I will
only be out $20 so it's worth a shot. 

Stay tuned.
