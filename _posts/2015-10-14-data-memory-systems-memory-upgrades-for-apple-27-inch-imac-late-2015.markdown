Data Memory Systems also now carries ram for Apple’s new iMacs. The selection isn’t as big as some other vendors but with the [8GB RAM Upgrade from DMS](http://www.datamemorysystems.com/dm50-239-1l/) for the Apple 27 inch Late 2015 models you will be able to max out the iMac to 32GB for under $200.00, which is about half the price if you bought the ram from Apple directly.
