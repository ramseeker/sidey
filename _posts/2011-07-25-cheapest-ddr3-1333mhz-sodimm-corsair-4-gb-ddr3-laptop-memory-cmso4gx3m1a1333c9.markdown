If you’re in the market to find the [best deal on computer parts](http://www.jim.am) such as RAM or even hard drives and your notebook takes or requires DDR3 1333Mhz 10600 204 pin sodimms that a lot of laptops do in 2011 then you really can’t go wrong with this corsair memory module at Amazon as it’s the **[cheapest 4GB DDR3 ram for notebook](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002YU83YO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ramseeker-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=B002YU83YO)** I could find at Amazon, or anywhere else ( this may change over time)




[![cheapest corsair RAM upgrade for notebooks](http://www.jim.am/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Corsair-DDR3-Laptop-Memory-Kit.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002YU83YO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ramseeker-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=B002YU83YO)




 




This 4GB RAM module is compatible with pretty much every Apple computer current in 2011:




MacBook Pro notebook computers requires the use of two of these memory upgrade modules to max out your memory in 2011, and with the iMac, and for all but the cheapest iMac – you’ll need to buy two of these memory modules to add another 8GB of iMac RAM, and with the release of the new Apple Mac Minis, this is another Apple computer that can  use the maximum of 8GB by **[buying two of these corsair 4GB RAM modules](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002YU83YO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ramseeker-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=B002YU83YO)**.




Of course,  there’s numerous notebook manufacturers that recommend the use of ddr3 sodimms for ram upgrades and most notebooks can take 8GB easy so make your windows machine run faster with the maximum ram possible as it’s so so cheap now.




If either saving money on RAM or the corsair brand doesn’t work for you there’s other solutions when it comes to buying 4GB DDR3 notebook memory on sale.
