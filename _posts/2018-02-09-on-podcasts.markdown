When I first moved in  BW and I could not be any more different when it came to what we listened to. I moved in stereos and speakers galore and listened **only** to music, while BW listened to **only** NPR.




(Oh, and that Journey CD she has in the car at full volume)




Now I think we have rubbed off on each other. We share a family Google Play music plan and I’ve become a fan of NPR, so much so that I found the world of podcasts which make my drive to and from work so much more enjoyable.




Also, I clean the house listening with my little bluetooth headphones and BW has no problem with this at all.




If you’ve never tried a podcast, I suggest giving one a try. I tend to listen to some politics stuff, and of course computer podcasts but I also like the history podcasts too - As I write this I am learning about the 10th Ammendment. I guess marrying a historian is rubbing off.




I always thought podcasts were silly because why would you listen to people talking when you could listen to music but over the past year or so I have really been enjoying  them.




Maybe it’s because after a while you can only stomach so much of that Journey CD.
