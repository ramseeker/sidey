USB-C is the future to be sure, but we are years away from it replacing legacy ports like USB 3 as we still have thumb drives, hard drives and other devices that still need to connect to newer devices like the Apple MacBook or MacBook Pro that only offer USB-C ports.




This cheap adapter solves the problem of using your peripherals with computers with USB-C ports
