Today was her first step. It's a start.

Earlier this evening I had her standing with the help of her [walker](https://amzn.to/2XUsZek) and over the time she pushed away the walker so that she was bent over hanging onto the walker and well, screaming - because walking is scary.

I wondered when this day would come.

I had to help her. I grabbed one of her legs and put it where it should be - closer to the walker and in front of her and then waited...

And she did it! She cautiously lifted her left leg and brought it to be in line with her right.

Yay! Somethimes it's the little things.

Also, the [dryer is working](https://jim.am/samsung-dryer-crap/) thanks to a $350.00 cash infusion. Apparently the rollers on the thing where worn square which would explain the the knocking sound.
