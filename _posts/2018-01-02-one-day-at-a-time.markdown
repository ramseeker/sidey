Happy New Year Everybody.




If I have one resolution it’s to try and write a bit more here, and share some photos. I keep thinking I have to wait until I have some great novel composed or we have to go on great adventures before I have something to write about.




But then I don’t write at all and I regret that so maybe this is the year that this all changes and I actually get an audience of more than about five readers. Or…not. We shall see.




The photo you see is the view from my ‘office’ at work. It was a little cold out for the first day of the year and it looks to stay cold for the remainder of the week.




Lastly, the other resolution I have is to eat more [pie](https://jim.am/i-like-pie/). Hope your 2018 will be a great one. ?




Keep Warm.




TH, and Co.
