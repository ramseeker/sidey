It started with just one.




I had just finished using this:

and on the way back to the house I saw it:** the weed.**




Now this wasn’t any old weed. This was waist high. And I thought, hoo boy am I going to be in big trouble when BW comes back and finds that weed at eye level.




So, I pulled it.




and then another




and another




and another




and before you know it: this happened

Now, to the untrained eye, this doesn’t look like much but what you see here is over **3 hours of gardening. **. Now I will ask you to read this last bit again where it says I gardened because the entire plotline of this story hinges on this one fact that I pulled weeds out of the ground and garden. **That’s twice now. TWICE, people.**




The second photo doesn’t look like much and needs some explaining.




Between the fence and our neighbours railway ties is a son of a gun to clean. leaves and other crap gets caught in no mans land between there and I suppose if this were the mccoys vs the hatfields you could spend hours arguing who’s mess this was. Technically, I think it’s not ours but no matter. Not only do dead leaves get behind here but also other items too. I found:






  1. 


a metal stake





  2. 


a chair cushion.





  3. 


a lawn bag full of leaves.







The problem was how do I get between the rock and the hard place? My leaf blower won’t work because if the leaves were able to blow they would have blown away. I can’t get my hand in there to reach under the fence unless I start to dig  - so what’s a guy to do?




I cleaned out the **entire length of the backyard with a stir stick** for a paint can left over from my painting adventures. I could get the stir stick under the fence enough to fish out the leaves and lawn furniture and other items. There I was down on my knees with a stir sitck trying to pull out weeds and leaves and brances. How I got into this I will never know.




But, it looks a little better now.




Once I got the big stuff out I could clean out the remainder of the gap with the leaf blower and then raked the whole mess out and up and I had to hurry because I had so much fun it was starting to get dark.




Also: I found a great way to weed the garden: **You take the leaf blower to it.** It blows away all the loose grass clippings and surface dirt and then it’s really easy to see the weeds and yank ‘em.




Works like a charm. Here’s the before:

Heh.




And every day I think two things:






  1. 


I have nothing to write about for today.





  2. 


All the work around the house is done.







Apparently, I’m wrong on both accounts.
