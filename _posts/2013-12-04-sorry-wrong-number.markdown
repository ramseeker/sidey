This is  what BW wanted to say to me today when I  reminded her that today was our day 2 for our new running regimen. Today we had to run 8x 60 second sprints and then rest for 90 seconds. Nice weather for it today -  cool , but bright today.




BW’s quote of the day: “ I like putting the calories in better”. She will be pleased to know our next run is really just a walk/light jog so should be a breeze.
