I hav been getting rid of some stuff over the past few days..not so much for the money but just to lighten the load a bit of stuff I find myself owning but not using enough.

Case in point, [these headphones you see here](https://amzn.to/2Bmltwg)

They never fit me right. I have **tried** to lik them over the years but I just can't seem to get comfortable with them and they hurt my head after a very short listening session so there's no sense keeping crap you don't use or hate.

This is just the one of many things I am getting rid of recently.
