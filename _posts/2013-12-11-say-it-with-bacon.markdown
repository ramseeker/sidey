3 years ago today BW and I met for breakfast. And I haven’t been the same since. ?




So, to celebrate the event instead of flowers, we went for breakfast at our favorite breakfast haunts, [Dick and Jenny’s](http://www.dickandjennysny.com/) on the island. They also have lunch (BW wanted to go back) and dinner too and it’s all very good. And speaking of all good, it’s a good thing BW said yes to date number 2 or I’d never know about how great both breakfast and married life could be.
