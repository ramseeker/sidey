“You should take more pictures” BW said to me the other day as we were perusing some photos I/we took this summer.




And, she’s right. I should.  I’m not sure why I’ve stopped in recent  months, but I have and I think I’d like to try again and get to shooting more.




The problem with this blog is that I/we are really not that interesting every day and as such I’ve been ignoring it. I’ve posted the odd photo to facebook but for the most part I’ve not photographed enough.




I’ve been inspired by [this blog](http://www.topleftpixel.com) where the photographer took a photo every day for a **decade. **How cool would that be to go through your archives and look back at all that’s happened. He’s shooting in Toronto for the most part and gets out every day to take and upload a photo. He’s got photos of Sam the Record Man and other Toronto Landmarks that are no longer downtown. After a decade he called it quits quite likely due to the fact that he went from single guy to 2 kiddos and life and also: it’s pretty tricky to take a photo every day that’s interesting.




This could very well be another started project that doesn’t continue long but hey, I’m gonna try. And this spider starts things off..




Here goes…
