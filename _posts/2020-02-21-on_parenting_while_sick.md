I don't know how you people do it. Last week I was sick with flu-like symptoms (probably [rotovirus](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rotavirus/symptoms-causes/syc-20351300)) and I couldn't do it.  I **had to go to bed**. 

Thankfully my wife was able to take over the parenting for the last few hours of the day when I gave up but for those that have more than one kid or are the **only parent**, you have my respect.  This shit is hard.
