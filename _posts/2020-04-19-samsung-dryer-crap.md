Our [Samsung Dryer](https://amzn.to/3eCCaWq) crapped out. In a pandemic.

Under normal circumstances we would be out a dryer for a few days and then back in business when the repair guy leaves.

But with the coronavirus situation **who knows** when I can get anybody to come to the house to fix this thing.

So, laundromat it is. While it is inconvenient is doable and far from the end of the world.  It's not like we have anything else to do. It will be good to get out of the house - even if it is only for an hour to wash clothes.

Who ever thought that going to the laundromat would be the big adventure of the day?

It's not even the money that pisses me off. Considering the state of this nation, the fact that a few things go wrong like this is of no importance whatsoever. We're all healthy and the rest is just details.

The thing that pisses me off is that this dryer is just 4 years old and this will be the second time I have had to have this thing repaired. Of course, the one year warranty on this thing is long gone so we will be out of pocket for this repair.

I don't think I will buy a Samsung again. Lesson Learned
