[![Best Price on Apple Mac Mini](http://www.jim.am/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-Shot-2011-09-02-at-7.28.18-AM.png)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YLCLM6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ramseeker-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399373&creativeASIN=B004YLCLM6)




**[Best Price on Apple Mac Mini Intel Core i5 2.3Ghz (Mid 2011) ](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YLCLM6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ramseeker-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399373&creativeASIN=B004YLCLM6)**




The Apple Mac Mini with an Intel Core i5 2.3GHz processor is the **[cheapest Apple computer you can buy](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&redirect=true&ref_=sr_nr_n_0&keywords=apple%20computer&bbn=493964&qid=1314967620&rnid=493964&rh=n%3A172282%2Ck%3Aapple%20computer%2Cn%3A%21493964%2Cn%3A541966#?_encoding=UTF8&tag=ramseeker-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957)** and makes a great choice for a student computer or home theater or music server, just two applications the Apple Mac Mini could be used for.




One reason the **[Mac Mini is so cheap](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YLCLM6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ramseeker-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399373&creativeASIN=B004YLCLM6)**, is that this is the only Apple computer that doesn’t come shipped with a keyboard, mouse or monitor. If you need these, you may be better off **[buying an Apple iMac](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&x=0&ref_=nb_sb_noss&y=0&field-keywords=imac&url=search-alias%3Daps#?_encoding=UTF8&tag=ramseeker-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957)** instead as the savings on this cheap desktop from Apple will be much less when you factor in the cost of Apple peripherals.




The Apple Mac Mini ships standard from Apple with just 2GB of memory installed in it from Apple (one reason the Mac Mini is so cheap) but using the two available memory slots in the Apple Mac Mini you can install up to 8GB of RAM by adding a **8GB Mac Mini Memory Upgrade Kit** that is priced currently at about $50* you could see an additional 50% or more of a performance upgrade by upgrading the 2011 Apple Mac Mini to the full 8GB of RAM it can recognize.




**Where To Buy Mac Mini 2.3 GHz RAM.




**




One store that sells name brand memory for Mac Mini as well as other computer brands is [Crucial Technology](http://amzn.to/2oA2gjC), but as I write this the cheapest Mac Mini RAM for the Intel Core i5 2011 version is Corsair memory available **[on sale at Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002YUF8ZG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ramseeker-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=B002YUF8ZG)** and beats the Crucial memory price by a fair margin.




With ram prices so cheap for Apple Mac Mini Intel Core i5 2.3 GHz, I fully recommend you go straight to the 8GB maximum memory by filling the two available RAM slots the Mac Mini offers. If you’re really on a tight budget you could buy a 4GB Mac Mini RAM kit instead that still doubles your RAM, but with 8GB of RAM so cheap you’re best to go straight to 8GB of Mac Mini RAM.

**How To Install RAM in Apple Mac Mini Intel Core i5 2.3GHz

Memory Installation on the Apple Mac Mini does not need to be done by a service professional (this wasn’t always the case) and if you follow the [Mac Mini RAM instructions](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4432#1) from Apple you will have no problems. The design on the new Mac Mini’s are brilliant as this is one of the only Apple computers you don’t need to use any tools with. The bottom cover on the underside of the Mac Mini twists off like you would a lid on a jar where the the entire RAM modules are easily accessible and with your fingers only you can remove and replace Apple Mac Mini Memory with ease.




*ram prices change for all computers and recently have been dropping.
