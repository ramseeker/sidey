This is why we canâ€™t leave the wild animal alone because she find trouble to get into. Today was some candy wrappers that BW saves because she is [now the recycling queen. ](http://jim.am/2018/02/11/the-100-cardboard-box/)




BW had them stuck in a empty peanut butter jar and in a bag on the floor. I can only imagine the dog watches us leave and as soon as she sees taillights down the road she goes straight for it.




Today, the dog found a prize.




The prize we get? BW has the FLU
