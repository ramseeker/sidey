I guess it’s about time for the first annual summer roundup here on Tidy Husband - one of many I hope. I had started this blog for one thing, and that’s to remember all the silly little things one does, or at least the ones  I write about. I don’t blog every day here because well, some days the fact that I lost a sock in the dryer, it’s garbage night doesn’t reallly qualify for an article. Also, these things take time for me to write, and sometimes when I have a choice to hang out with BW or blog, I pick hanging out with a beautiful woman…




Anyway, here goes: the first annual **what I did on my summer vacation: **






  1. 


I started this [thing](http://www.jim.am). Technically I started in May but what the heck - we’ll start here. This blogging has been much more fun than I care to admit most days. There’s many a time I’m laughing at the stuff I write it’s so silly.





  2. 


I wrote about her shoes. it started with the shoes, and boy [does she have a lot of ‘em ](http://jim.am/does-your-wife-have-too-many-shoes/)





  3. 


I shared how we met. ([the dog,](http://jim.am/the-dog/) not BW)

We dreamed about [ buying a new car](http://jim.am/what-car-to-buy-new-car-used-car-or-somewhere-in-between/)





  11. 


I bet our um, summer running regimen [didn’t last a month ](http://jim.am/we-run/). There’s always next year





  12. 


We planted flower seeds off eBay in [our front garden](http://jim.am/summer-flower-project-2012/)

Getting Married is really just a big party to celebrate the fact that you’ll be [painting everything she owns](http://jim.am/ten-easy-steps-on-how-to-paint-a-living-room-and-stairway/) eventually over time. Get to know the paint people at the home depot. They’re your new friends.

It’s the end of the world as we know it, [and I feel fine ](http://jim.am/tb-or-not-tb-that-is-the-question/)







And that’s it for the summer of 2012 . 72 different things of note that I want to remember from this summer’s events.  A few of the hits of 2012  - are of course, the box on the head in the backyard, getting published in the new york timess, getting a book out the door for publishing and painting everything in sight. Also, the dog and I gained some weight.




I  wonder what the fall will bring for us? Time will tell I guess.. and that’s the fun part.
