**An 8GB RAM Upgrade does not cost much at all. **




** **In fact, RAM for the Apple MacBook Pros released in February 2011 has never been cheaper, and if you’re looking to upgrade an older MacBook Pro from 2009 or 2010 – even though the 2011 and 2010 MacBook Pros use different RAM (1333MHz sodimms vs 1066Mhz sodimms) the prices for an upgrade to the MacBook Pro’s maximum could cost you less than $50 if you trade in your old 4GB RAM.




**Let’s have a look, shall we?**




For a 2011 MacBook Pro, regardless of screen size or cost the ram required is a[n **8GB DDR3 SDRAM sodimm memory upgrade kit**,](http://www.jim.am/8GB) where most memory stores will happily sell you, (see ram price chart for MacBook Pros below)  but the [cheapest MacBook Pro RAM](http://www.jim.am/cheapest-ram-upgrades-for-apple-computers-july-25-2011/) currently sits at about $**[55 for  an 8GB upgrade](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002YUF8ZG/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=ramseeker-20&camp=213381&creative=390973&linkCode=as4&creativeASIN=B002YUF8ZG&adid=1M72YM31597Z6H77GVMK&)**, quite the price drop from the $90 or so the market demanded for MacBook Pro RAM just a few  months prior to today.




But to max out the memory on your MacBook Pro, you’ll need to replace the 2x2GB memory upgrade modules that shipped standard with your Apple notebook and replace them with 2x4GB memory modules.




This leaves you with an extra 4GB of MacBook Pro RAM, you’re not really sure what to do with, but you have a few options to make the upgrade from 4GB to 8GB even cheaper:




**Sell your memory online**




[ craigslist ](http://www.craigslist.org)and [ebay ](http://www.ebay.com)are great sites to make money from your old RAM, effectively reducing the total cost of your 8GB MacBook Pro RAM upgrade




**Trade in your memory **




There’s more  than one memory store that will apply your old MacBook Pro RAM  to  the total cost of your 8GB upgrade




**Donate your memory** there’s lots of  organizations that will take your memory  donation  where they can sell it and use the proceeds from your old memory to support their cause.  [Salvation Army](http://www.salvationarmyusa.org/usn/www_usn_2.nsf) and [Goodwill ](http://www.salvationarmyusa.org/usn/www_usn_2.nsf)will take memory upgrade donations, or perhaps there’s a school or other way  to help others with your factory, but still perfectly usable 4GB memory upgrade.




To summarize, if you buy RAM for MacBook Pro that’s not only the cheapest it’s ever been (now is the best time to buy Apple Memory) but sell or donate the MacBook Pro’s factory installed memory you should be able to realize a total cost of under $50 for an 8GB MacBook Pro Memory Upgrade
