[Cheap RAM](http://www.jim.am). There’s a good chance that you’re here reading this because you typed ‘cheap ram’ into your browser or search engine and you clicked a link that looks interesting and you’re here. Now, I have to prove myself and actually help you find what you came for, which in this case is Cheap RAM

If you’re looking to buy ram (or memory) you’re closer to your destination but not quite, as I don’t sell any RAM. Not one stick,never have and after 13 years at this it’s probably safe to say that I never will. What I do though is help you get the best deal on RAM for you that’s right for you and yes, I do advertise the lowest ram prices for Mac, or even cheapest PC RAM it’s just because like you, most are just looking to buy the cheapest RAM you can find. You want a deal on RAM memory as it can be expensive for what it is and it’s hard to measure performance with RAM. Yes, your computer is going to run faster and smoother and there won’t be as many crashes or blue screens of death but still, it’s not like say adding a hard drive where when you do that you get a neat little window that says wow, look at all the free space you have to fill up with more and more data.




But with RAM, cheap or no the effects and benefits can be less but still allow you to work faster and with less hassle from computers, which I’m sure I don’t have to tell you: computers are great when they work and are a big pain in the..well, you know when they don’t. And that’ where adding RAM does offer the greatest value: There’s less chance of user frustration when you fill up your computer with RAM regardless of the model, you still get more work done faster and with less grief and misery. That’s where RAM upgrades really shine.




But RAM’s not cheap. Especially at first when it’s released. I remember about a year ago, to fill up your iMac to 8GB (which at the time was the maximum RAM you could buy) it cost just as much as the iMac itself, which is just nuts. Thankfully as demand and supply increase, ram prices drop like a stone and quickly.




The trouble with cheap ram is that you could be setting your self up for customer service headaches if you buy ram from memory stores that don’t offer a few essentials: A secure website to order from – It’s 2010 and indentity theft is real and scary. Do you know who you’re sending your credit card information to? And how about a guarantee? When some sellers of memory offer ram at the cheapest prices, they do so at the cost of customer service. Some sales are final or they make it so hard to deal with returns and shipping that the few bucks that you saved on the cheapest ram might not feel like much of a savings if you can’t get support if you have trouble for your memory purchase.




Which is why I always suggest that you buy RAM from the stores I list as they all have been selling memory upgrades for at least as long as I have been tracking ram prices and that my friends has a value you can’t put a sticker price on. Some are big corportations and some are smaller small businesses and some even specialize in just Apple Memory and don’t bother with PC RAM at all. But do yourself a favor and forget the cheapest RAM and buy the RAM that’s guaranteed to work from a memory store you can trust.




That’s the real value in my opinion. But, not to disappoint – here’s a list of the **[cheapest mac ram](http://www.jim.am/#lowest)** and the [cheapest PC RAM](http://www.jim.am/pc/index.php#lowest). Enjoy.
