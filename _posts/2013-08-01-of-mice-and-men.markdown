This is a story about shoelaces




You see, here at chez 440 we have a rule - no shoes in the house.




An due to the fact we live in a drive-able only suburban area -  except for a spin around the  block with my four legged friend - we drive the car and use the door between the garage and the house way more than the front door which is just for the odd guest and the UPS guy.




And due to this fact, and we find it’s just a good practice - we kick off our shoes in the garage.




Now for years this little system works great for a few reasons:




You’re not tripping over shoes at the door, the dog can’t eat your shoes. Yes, it’s been done. (BAD DOG), and I don’t have to vacuum as often due to the fact that there’s less dirt tracked in my us humans anyway.




So.




I go out to the garage to toss on my shoes and the **shoelaces are gone**. Well, they’re there but there’s hardly an inch to grab on to to tie with and the plastic ends are gone and what’s left of the ends are frayed to bits.




I didn’t think much of it and just grabbed another pair to put on.




The next day I go out and go to put on my footwear and this is another pair of shoes that has it’s ends gone. gone. gone.




What the heck?




Then it dawned on me: **Mice!** (at least  I think so)




**The little buggers have been chewing on my shoelaces**. Often we’ll leave the garage open until it’s time to go to bed and so my guess is  they have found a love for my shoelaces recently and all they leave me is the nubs. Little buggers.




So,  I go to the dollar store and find  eight pairs of shoelaces for just a buck! Woo Hoo! That’s 12.5 cents a pair - a pretty good deal.




I get home, yank  a pair out and start lacing.  I only get  halfway. These laces are short! real short! Aw man I thought:  you mean to tell me I bought the wrong size? Also: there’s sizes????!!




But then further inspection realized that I bought the variety pack of shoelaces with various sizes from 27 inches to 54 inches in length. We now have extra shoelaces for any foot size. If you need  shoelaces call me first. I can help.




Lessons learned?




Shoelaces are tasty to mice.  

Shoelaces come in sizes.  

I can write an entire blog post about shoelaces.




PS. 7 more sleeps!
