Probably two of the hottest selling electronics right now have to be Mac Laptops otherwise known as MacBook and MacBook Pro and digital cameras. And the best part, is that without the one, you can’t use the other. A digital camera is pretty much useless if you cannot transfer your photos to your Mac Laptop and then share the with the world, or at very least your friends and family. And when you buy a mac laptop you are equipped with Apple’s software suite right out of the box and that includes iPhoto which offers a fast and easy way to organize, edit and share your photos.

**Where to Buy a Mac Laptop and Digital Camera. **




If you buy your MacBook from the Apple Store, you can save money but only on the refurbished MacBooks.  And these are fine and and easy way  to save some money, but for this article I am going to assume you want to buy a new mac laptop. Maybe you are starting school soon and you need to buy a new mac laptop  to take with you when you go away to school. I have searched high and low and I found the easiest way to save money on a Mac Laptop and a digital camera is to buy the two together at Amazon.




The reason for this is that when you do this you will get a deal on both and in some cases you can add accessories to both and save even more money on the MacBook or MacBook pro. One Apple notebook bundle you might want to consider is one that includes a case, and an extra charger and maybe some special cleaner for the display, or how about an extra charger? You can get  a pretty great deal on Apple bundles.




Right now, when you buy a new MacBook you can get a free iPod too. This is only a back to school offer so if you’re interested in doing this I would buy your MacBook soooner than later




For the digital cameras, there are many choices and I have written enough  for now, but you apply the same logic when buying a digital camer too. Find the discount digital camera you want and start adding accessories such as extra lenses. There are many ways to expand your digital camera with cases and digital camera memory too, so it’s best to bundle.




When you wan to get a deal on a Mac Laptop and Digital Camera, do your homework when making your choices and when you are ready to buy a MacBook or buy a digital camera you will happy with the choices you have made.
