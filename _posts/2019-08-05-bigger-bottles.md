We don't travel much right now because of the fact that we have an infant and one of the more tricky parts of all this was **how do we feed her** when we are away from a [fridge full of baby bottles](https://amzn.to/2YLaC8r) and the [bottle warmer](https://amzn.to/2KfHa6l)?

The trick is [ready to eat formula](https://amzn.to/2YEKTyo) that does not require refrigeration or any special care. Now we can leave the house for more than twenty minutes at a time. This makes a **huge** difference in our lives!

We knew about the smaller [2oz bottles](https://amzn.to/33bdcYG) but did not know that they also had [bigger 8 oz bottles](https://amzn.to/2YtDff2) too.

And you know what? They are not priced all that bad - about two bucks a bottle. I would not want to feed my child with **just these** because that gets pricey real fast, but for road trips or day trips then the fact that you don't  have to worry about warming a bottle, well...warms my heart. :)
