The Apple Mac Mini is my new favorite Mac in the Apple lineup and for one reason: It’s cheap.




I have already compared the iMac and Mac Mini and when you do the math, it’s not hard to save up  to $300 when you buy a Mac Mini and external mouse, monitor, and keyboard as opposed to pulling the trigger on an iMac.




What could you do with the extra money you save? Buy a SSD drive, as they are getting big enough and cheap enough to use as your main hard drive. (with limitations). The biggest limitation being your budget, and remembering that you’re looking to upgrade a $600 desktop here. You have to stop and ask yourself is it really worth it to pour another $500 or so into it. If you add 16GB of RAM in addition to the Mac Mini, you may just be better off buying a Mac Pro.




Regardless, the Mac Mini SSD Drive options are many and here’s a few options to consider: These will also work just fine in your MacBook Pro and iMacs too.

With a street price of under $200, the latest in solid state drive technology from Crucial comes in the form of the Crucial 128MB M4 SSD drive. At just 128MB, you may be limited in your storage space when compared to bigger conventional hard drives but you win when it comes to boot time and drive access speed, allowing you to work faster




The crucial m4 128MB solid state drive is the best selling SSD drive today, and is compatible with more than just the Apple Mac Mini, but works with all others in the Apple lineup and any other Windows OS model that can accept a 2.5 inch SATA form factor.

[![Best Price on a Mac Mini SSD](http://www.jim.am/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Screen-Shot-2011-10-07-at-7.40.22-AM.png)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004W2JKWG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ramseeker-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399373&creativeASIN=B004W2JKWG)If you’re low on funds, and the 128GB is stretching your budget, you can opt for the cheaper SSD drive in Crucial’s lineup, [the 64GB version instead of the 128GB](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004W2JKWG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ramseeker-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399373&creativeASIN=B004W2JKWG).  This gets you into one of the cheapest Mac Mini SSD drives available today for just a touch over $100.  You won’t have much room for files when compared to the bigger 128GB model, but as the Mac Mini isn’t going anywhere you can always buy a [cheap external drive](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0045JLPMO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ramseeker-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=B0045JLPMO) with more storage capacity and hook it  up to the little Mac. A hundred dollar SSD upgrade is the best bargain for a Mac Mini SSD option as it allows fast access to common files and the Mac OS for super fast startup times, yet doesn’t cost too much compared to the Mac Mini. Upgrade the Mac Min RAM to 8Gb at the same time, and for $150 or less, you have a much faster Mac Mini when you bought the Mac Mini from Apple.
