It’s Thanksgiving up there in Canader so I thought I’d take a minute to write about how lucky I am. I give BW a hard time here, but really she’s the best thing that ever happened to me (even if she does make me [paint](http://jim.am/ten-easy-steps-on-how-to-paint-a-living-room-and-stairway/)) and that’s because together we found this:

I’m not quite sure how we found this place. I think we were searching online for a breakfast place and they were local (we don’t have to leave the island!) and after we went there the first time, we both thought the same thing: **[Dick N’ Jenny,](http://www.dickandjennysny.com/) where have you been all our lives?** (we’ve also recently found the best donuts in town but that’s an  article for another day). It’s all about the food.

You get to choose a pastry with your breakfast - instead of plain old toast.

bottomless coffee, and though not shown - they make homemade donuts!

Fresh fruit balances out the gagillion calories, right? I think I read that somewhere

We always stumble out happy (and a little bit fatter)




Happy Thanksgiving to all the turkeys back home. ?
