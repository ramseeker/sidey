I was **outside** today filling up the car in case we **do have an emergency** and need to leave the house at least the car is full. And while at the gas station, I saw the UPS Truck.

And I got to thinking that these folks need our appreciation in addtion to the [front line workers](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/opinion/letters/coronavirus-health-care.html) at our hospitals there also **so many others** that need our thanks while we're tucked in our homes while we [PAUSE](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/amid-ongoing-covid-19-pandemic-governor-cuomo-announces-nys-pause-extended-until-may-15) and stuck in our homes there are many out there who are **working hard** to make sure we have the neccesities of life (also, cookies.).

So, to those working in the trucking, grocery, delivery, mail trades or anybody else who ventures outside in these scary times - thank you for the hard work and dangers you face everyday in your workday.
