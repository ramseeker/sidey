She's not quite there yet but her days are numbered when it comes to using these and boy, I have to tell you that they have been[ very handy](https://amzn.to/2KgEm8Z)  Yes, we have a chair that she can sit in:

But it's just not going to be the same as you have to be sure arms and legs are where they need to be and then you have to buckle them in so they are safe. With the boppy, you just plop down the boppy and plop the kiddo in it. [They are awesome.](https://amzn.to/2YIDKgz)
