Hello Dear Readers… (Hi Dad!)




Remember when this was a daily blog? Yeah, me too. It’s just that I don’t think you really need to see photos of my dinner every night and a lot of the days are really just another day in paradise. Or…maybe you do want to see that I eat well..

We live exciting lives, I tell you - just ask the dog:

But the big news this weekend **I went outside!  **(I was starting to get a little stir crazy in the burbs)




I’ve been housebound for the last few weeks, but i’m on the mend so for fun and excitement we went to:




[![DSCN0314](http://jim.am/images /2012/10/DSCN0314.jpg)](http://jim.am/images /2012/10/DSCN0314.jpg)




where we went in for razors and some other little thing and before you know it we’ve got the cart loaded with a slow cooker, 2 huge party packs of animal crackers (hey, dont’ judge me) ands some sweaters for BW so she can go to work all respectable looking like. The touch was over $100 but that’s to be expected in any store like this.. IKEA, Costco - they’re all the same. If you get out of there under $100 you’re laughing.




Oh, We also bought this:

These are our fancy new mirrors that BW said we needed. and when we got home I hear what every man loves to hear: “let’s hang our mirrors’. Now, this is where I get to explain what really happens when we hang mirrors:






  * 


BW rips open box of mirrors





  * 


I go downstairs to see if we have any small finishing nails and to grab a hammer.





  * 


I come back and ask where she wants said mirrors installed.





  * 


She replies: “Up a little higher. Now over that way. No, the other way”





  * 


We sing this song seven more times  - one for each mirror.





  * 


My arms start to hurt because I’ve been holding mirrors above my head.





  * 


BW disappears..(this, I am learning is her favorite tactic - ‘we’ means ‘me” - she’ll start then poof,  she’s gone)





  * 


I clean up tools





  * 


I take photo above to show off my muscular physique.







But, they do look good and now that the mirrors are hung - we decorated indoors a touch too:

But that’s not all..




After our big adventure at Target, we went to the pet store to look for dog treats (they didn’t have ‘em) and on our way out saw..

Fish!




But the best part is that on the way out BW sees these heating pads for dogs. Yes, you heard right - **she wants to buy the dog a heating pad for it’s bed** for the winter. I tried to explain that the dog comes with a heating pad - it’s called heated carpet (see photo above) and also have you noticed **the dog is wearing a fur coat?!**




But hey, what do I know?  It’s bad enough the dog has the best bed in the house (memory foam) but now she wants to cough up $100 for an electric doggie blanket. (sigh)




I guess it all works out in the end.  We all have our interests and priorities:  (picture’s a bit shakey - I was on cup number 6)

But it’s looking like the dog will be the most comfortable one in the house this winter.




**Fall Harvest**




And with the first frost hitting our area, that’s the end of the road for our very first vegetable garden and so BW went out and harvested our winter’s veggies:

I think we learned a couple lessons in our very first year of gardening:




Tomatoes don’t like heat  

Neither do snow peas  

or melons  

or beets




but.. Green Beans are the answer. They survived our lack of knowledge and we had quite a few harvests and as the photo shows we managed to rescue a few carrots too. We had a whole lot of fun for our $100 worth of dirt.




Lastly, I wanted to share a new photo blog I’ve started. I bought a small little point and shoot to tuck into a pocket and I’ve been taking some pretty neat photos with [this little $84.00 wonder](http://photodailynews.com/2012/10/09/nikon-coolpix-l26-real-life-shooting-review/) and needed some place to hang the results other than my hard drives. These are just snaps of stuff I see. You may see some duplication from here, but not all the time as some of the photos I take are just for the photo and not a blog post. I needed a spot where the photo is the blog post so I [started one on blogger.](http://ramseeker.blogspot.com) I’d love to be able to post a photo every day. It doesn’t necessarily mean I will make a photo every day but I’ll publish a new one. I would like to keep things timely if I can so I am not posting summer photos in December. I’d love to take a new photo every day but no promises. At one time I was blogging every day, and we all know how that worked out.  [You’re welcome to stop by and have a look. ](http://ramseeker.blogspot.com)
