# Saturday




Now that we had over 2/3 of the driving done, I was packing up the car in the morning  at a leisurely pace when I noticed that our car didn’t really fit in with the locals:

But we didn’t have time to lollygag too much because we still had all of [Tennessee](https://www.tn.gov/) and [Alabama](http://alabama.com/)  to get through but we did have time for some stops and adventures




## Let’s Go to the Space Museum!




um…okay.




So off we go the[ space museum](http://www.rocketcenter.com/) in Huntsville Alabama which was about 2.5 hours south.




**insert more driving here**




But first, lunch. We had wanted to go get some soul food at this little hole in the wall, but it was closed, but  we did find [farmburger](http://www.farmburger.net/huntsville-al/) which was really good. As usual, I just had a plain old burger and fries but BW had a burger with all the fixings:


![IMG_20170603_121249450.jpg](https://jim.am/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_20170603_121249450.jpg)


and then once we had our burgers off to the space center we went. But before I share our adventures at the space center  I need to tell a quick story about BW losing stuff.




When we pulled into the parking lot of the space center we decided that BW would be the one to carry wallets/keys/etc so she went to get her laptop bag and use it as a shoulder bag.




Lo and behold, what did she find?


![IMG_20170603_125606901_HDR.jpg](https://jim.am/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_20170603_125606901_HDR.jpg)


You see, last January just after BW went on the hook for 2 years for a brand new [iPhone 7](http://apple.com/iphone) she called me in a panic at the airport while she was coming home from a conference in Denver.




“Jimmy, somebody stole my iphone!”




I went online and tracked it and we thought it was gone because the tracking showed it went from the airport to some seedy airport bar across the street. I wiped it remotely and we both realized that it was probably gone for good.




As luck would have it, I had her mothers’ older phone on my desk as I was supposed to sell it on eBay and didn’t get around to it yet so I just went to the Verizon store  and had them de-activate the lost model and activate the new one where I met BW at the airport with her brand new old iPhone.




Then. As you can already guess by the photo.. guess what BW found in her bag? Her  thought-to-be stolen iPhone 7! Woo Hoo. (I still have questions about how the phone showed it was at a bar across the street, but whatever.)




This bag I tell you is **magic. **Last week, BW called me in a panic (notice a theme here?) that when she got to the border to go to Canada and she could not find her nexus card.




Guess what she found the other day in this bag? Yup, the nexus card.




The problem with this bag is that there are **too many pockets** and BW (obviously by now) keeps on losing stuff in them.




Anyway. Crisis (s) averted. We have her iPhone 7. It’s all good.  At least now we are making payments on a phone we still possess now.




Onward and upwards to




## Space Photos!




The space center was actually nicer and more fun than I expected. Lots of interesting stuff to look at and learn about..





after we walked on the moon’s surface and avoided the gift shop attractions (actually, BW bought a mug) and saw what we could see at the center we then drove the remainder of the way to Mobile Alabama.




And finally, we had arrived here in Mobile.
