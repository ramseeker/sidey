How is this still even a thing?

**Surely** there must some way to send an encrypted email or some secure thing that would allow you to get the same result.

Nobody I know has a land line or even funnier - a modem. Yes, my printer has a fax machine in it but again - land line. Nobody knows what these are. My daughter won't that's for sure.

So. I had a problem: Send a fax while the **entire country** is pretty much shut down.

Yeah, good luck with that. So, some google FU skills found [faxzero](http://faxzero.com) and because I had a few pages to send it cost me $2.00 via Paypal but I am okay with that. And according to the website it was sent, and  I got an email saying so with a confirmation so hooray, fax sent.

Now in the morning I will call and be sure they got it, because you never know if they did or not but how can a fax machine be relevant in this new decade.

I just find it hard to believe I can upload this entire site to Google's servers to host **for free** by typing two words but I have to scramble to figure out how to send a fax.

I'm not sure what the solution would be. Under 'normal' circumstances you can usually find somewhere that will send or receive a fax for you locally and I guess if you fax a lot then the land/fax line thing isn't a big deal, but for us deplorables that use mobile phones as their only communication device we're sunk.

The best thing would be to **get rid of the fax** altogether and then you wouldn't have to worry. Apple's phones can lock you out so it's worthless, so the privacy technology is available or at least doable. I guess the trick is how? Heck, I can [rent a server](https://cloud.google.com/security/compliance/hipaa) that's HIPAA safe for a few bucks. It must be possible to do better than having to rely on faxes in 2020

Maybe this is like trying to 'build a better mouse trap'. The old mouse trap works fine, so why screw with it?

This must be the case with faxes, because it's not like everybody has easy access to a fax machine these days.
