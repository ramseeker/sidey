My big task of the day was take the Dog to and from the groomers as it was bath day (for her, not me)




Every time she gets a bath two things happen:






  1. 


We are out fifty bucks





  2. 


She gets a new bandana







I call this fifty-dollar dog day.




Anyway, today I go pick up the dog and notice the bills bandana and think nothing of it because I could care less about sports.




But BW is a [Philadelphia Eagles](http://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/) fan. And holy hell did she flip out when she saw the bandana. I thought she was going to disown us. ( I would probably be the first to go, as the dog does have seniority after all. )




There was grunting and complaining (from her, not the dog) and just overall unhappiness in the house overall for an hour or two until things settled down.




As I write this the dog is still wearing this but I bet BW won’t be able to stand it and will remove it.




Me? I’m rooting for the [Leafs](https://www.nhl.com/mapleleafs)
