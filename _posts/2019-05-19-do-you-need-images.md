Title: No Image Required

I have been looking at some of my post here that are most popular and one thing struck me - none of them have images.

Not. One.

This might make for a boring looking blog/site/whatever this is but boy it would cut down on the work and most of the images are just for illustration for the most part anyway and don't really offer any **value** when it comes to actual use.

I suppose if I had diagrams or the like then I suppose but most of the time the images I post don't  really do a lot anyway.

Yes, the offer a bit of visual flair to an otherwise boring wall of text but other than that they are kind of useless and just take up bandwidth and more time for the site to load.

So from now on I will try to write without images and see how it all works out.

We will see.
