Now that she has a [new tooth](https://jim.am/the_first_tooth/) the next big upgrade for her is her [very first laptop](https://amzn.to/32jdlby):

Jus one more plastic item for her to play with! It looks like it cost about $15.00 so it wasn't expensive which is good as it was a gift and despite the fact that **this has batteries** she seems to like it and it's kept her entertained for over 20 minutes at a time so I guess it's a hit. :)
