I really don’t know why I bother with this blog. It’s not like a soul reads the thing except BW.




Today wasn’t that much of an eventful day, and after the last few days I guess this is a good thing. I did have a doctor’s appointment though and like all things lately - there’s a story to tell.




Like always, the day started off OK with coffee and dog walks and I had a 10:30 am appointment at the doctors office.




The Doctor could not be closer to the Canadian border if you tried. It’s the last exit on the highway before you get to the queenston lewiston bridge. If you miss the exit, you’re going to Canada.




Anyway, after I boost the car I buzz off to the Doctor’s for my appointment so I can tell her I’m fine. I figured I would be home again in half an hour.




I was wrong.




I walked up to the desk, said I’m here and the nurse told me to wait. So, I did.




I waited  

and waited  

and waited  

and waited  

and waited.




At first, I really didn’t think much of it. They always overbook and it was taking some time for others to be called too so there’s that. But after I read every magazine they had I went up to a now new nurse and nobody had marked me as there, so they didn’t know I was waiting.




Bah.




All for a silly little followup appointment to tell her I’m fine.




I did managed to get some muscle relaxants out of her and from what she tells me and what I read on the interwebs this is some pretty high octane stuff. I’ve been on other meds that supposedly make you drowsy but the reviews on the internet talk about a hung over feeling and being out for hours.




I know, I know.. It’s always a risk asking doctor google. I’m old enough to remember a pre-google life and there was a time when you just did what the doctor told you to do. Now, you research before you go and then when you get back.




Anyway, the back is better today on it’s own so here’s hoping the meds do the trick.




If I disappear it’s because zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
