This computer costs about $850 currently and if you were to[ buy this model](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?ff3=4&toolid=11800&pub=5575019070&campid=5337133045&mpre=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2FRetina-15-Apple-MacBook-Pro-10-1-A1398-Core-i7-2-30GHz-256GB-SSD-16GB-HDMI-43-%2F112415713493%3Fhash%3Ditem1a2c7fa8d5%3Ag%3AQGoAAOSwc-tY3U0T) you really would not have to do a lot when it comes to upgrades. It already has 16GB of RAM and a fast SSD drive. I guess you could add a [larger SSD drive](http://amzn.to/2rXt4y8) but for my purposes the size is fine.




This is a 2012 computer so at five years old it might be a good ideal to [replace the battery ](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?ff3=4&toolid=11800&pub=5575019070&campid=5337133045&mpre=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fsch%2Fi.html%3F_from%3DR40%26_trksid%3Dp2047675.m570.l1313.TR9.TRC1.A0.H0.X2012%2Bmacbook%2Bpro%2Bbattery.TRS0%26_nkw%3D2012%2Bmacbook%2Bpro%2Bbattery%26_sacat%3D0) but that should only cost you about $30.00 or so. An extra charger would cost about $150.00 if you need an [extra power supply](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?ff3=4&toolid=11800&pub=5575019070&campid=5337133045&mpre=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fsch%2Fi.html%3F_odkw%3D2012%2Bmacbook%2Bpro%2Bbattery%26_osacat%3D0%26_from%3DR40%26_trksid%3Dp2045573.m570.l1313.TR4.TRC1.A0.H0.X2012%2Bmacbook%2Bpro%2Bcharger.TRS0%26_nkw%3D2012%2Bmacbook%2Bpro%2Bcharger%26_sacat%3D0) as the battery life on a a 2012 model isn’t as great than with a newer MacBook Pro.
