Verizon's phone plans with unlimited data are broken down into four categories: 

##  Above Unlimited

Above Unlimited  is  aimed for power users that live on their phones and demand the best performance. If you have this plan, you are probably on a top tier phone and  need all the data and speed possible. The Above Unlimited plan from Verizon offers: 

- Unlimited 4G Data

## Go Unlimited

Go Unlimited is aimed at those users that want unlimited but don't need the extra features and cost of the two plans above. 

- Unlimited Data

- Unlimited Talk and Text

- DVD Quality Streaming

- Unlimited Mobile HotSpot

- Mexico and Canada Talk, Text and Data

- Free Apple Music for 6 months

## Just Kids

If  you have kids that need or want a smartphone then you definitely don't need to spend a lot and have the kids burn through your data. This plan offers the following features: 

- 5GB of 4G Data

- Unlimited Talk and Text to 20 contacts

- Safety Mode to Avoid Data Overages

- Verizon Smart Family

- DVD Quality Streaming

- Verizon Up Rewards

## Verizon Unlimited Plan Prices

Above Unlimited - $95.00 per line

Beyond Unlimited  - $85.00 per line

Go Unlimited - $75.00 per line

Just Kids - $35.00 per line

## What's the Best Unlimited Verizon Plan? 

 

If it we me, I would probably go with the Go Unlimited Plan as I really only use abut 3GB a month, but I do travel to Canada a fair bit so the fact that I can use my phone there as I would inside the US would be a great thing to have.
