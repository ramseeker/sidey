This Apple iMac sells for less than [$150.00](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?ff3=4&toolid=11800&pub=5575019070&campid=5337133045&mpre=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2FApple-iMAC-A1224-Mid-2009-20-Intel-Core-2-Duo-2-00-GHz-4GB-160GB-El-Capitan%2F162547688947). It’s an older model to be sure and there a may faster iMacs but it’s hard to beat the price. The lastest MacOS you can install on this is[ El Capitan](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT206886).




The maximum ram you can install is 8GB of RAM and that should only [cost about $50.0](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?ff3=4&toolid=11800&pub=5575019070&campid=5337133045&mpre=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fsch%2Fi.html%3F_from%3DR40%26_trksid%3Dp2380057.m570.l1313.TR0.TRC0.H0.X8gb%2Bsodimm%2Bkit.TRS0%26_nkw%3D8gb%2Bsodimm%2Bkit%26_sacat%3D0)0 to upgrade. You can always [sell the older 4GB kit](https://jim.am/2011/01/06/where-can-i-sell-old-ram/) to make the cost of a ram upgrade for a 2009 Apple iMac even cheaper.




When it comes to hard drives you have two options - you can replace the 160GB drive with a larger hard drive like a[ 1TB hard drive ](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?ff3=4&toolid=11800&pub=5575019070&campid=5337133045&mpre=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fsch%2Fi.html%3F_odkw%3D8gb%2Bsodimm%2Bkit%26_osacat%3D0%26_from%3DR40%26_trksid%3Dp2045573.m570.l1313.TR2.TRC0.A0.H0.X1tb%2Bhard%2Bdrive%2Binternal.TRS0%26_nkw%3D1tb%2Bhard%2Bdrive%2Binternal%26_sacat%3D0)and this should only cost you about $50 to do. But if you want a faster mac and only need a bit more room than the stock hard drive then you should upgrade to a SSD drive. The 250GB SSD from Samsung is a best selling SSD and sells for[ under $100](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?ff3=4&toolid=11800&pub=5575019070&campid=5337133045&mpre=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fsch%2Fi.html%3F_from%3DR40%26_trksid%3Dp2374313.m570.l1311.R1.TR8.TRC1.A0.H0.X250gbssd.TRS0%26_nkw%3D250gb%2Bssd%26_sacat%3D0).




If you do install a SSD you will need a 3.5 inch to 2.5 inch adapter. I recommend the [icy dock model](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?ff3=4&toolid=11800&pub=5575019070&campid=5337133045&mpre=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2FICY-DOCK-2-5-to-3-5-SAS-SATA-HDD-SSD-Converter-Mount-Kit-Adapter-%2F351759199025%3Fhash%3Ditem51e67b6b31%3Ag%3APXAAAOSwepJXYH4Z) as there are no tools needed.




It does take a bit of work to get to to the hard drive to replace it on this iMac model but it’s not impossible.
