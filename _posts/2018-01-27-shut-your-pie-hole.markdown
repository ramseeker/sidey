My Just a quick one today, because: friday night and zzzzzz tired.




The good news is my [pi-hole ](https://pi-hole.net/)cup arrived:

The bad news is that BW made me take down the service as it was blocking her ads and she was getting **pissed off **without reliable internet so earlier this week I disabled it and now all is working and I should probably leave well enough alone because : happy wife = happy life.




But the nerd in me **really wants to have this** but BW won’t let me. She has put her foot down.




So I started to google and sure enough there’s a way to do so where my computers don’t see the ads and hers does. I told her about this and she asked where did I find out about this?




I turns out, I’m not the only guy with a[ pissed off wife and a pi-hole. ](https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/pihole-and-other-adblockers-block-reviews-for-clothing-sites-how-to-fix/3192)




There might be hope for me yet. Or, maybe I will just shut my pi(e)-hole and keep married.




Sigh, choices.
