I've been aboard the SS [PAUSE](https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/home) here locked in the house with a toddler for 40 days. That's the amount of days I have been unemployed thanks to the virus, and the efforts to contain it.

I'm not complaining. If I can stay home and **save a life** then I am all for that. It's just, the weather could be nicer  - you know? Even with nap times (Sporadic at best) it makes for a long day let me tell you. I have been locked here in the house with her for longer now that noah when he had to collect all the animals - you know the story.

Anyway, it's been a challenge sometimes. And she's a good kid too, it's just she's starting to be so **active** and it seems like I am always either shooing her away from danger or picking up after her. Also, how did rice grains get into her bedroom?

As it stands right now, I have another 20 days so far of being here at home with the kiddo and depending, it might be longer. It's a great way to bond with your daughter that's for sure when you spend **every waking hour** with her.

Today thankfully, it warmed up and I was able to take her out in the stroller for a long walk so that helps. I pity the parents that have to juggle both work and kids at home - at least I can dedicate all my time for her which when you think about it that way - 40 days together isn't so bad. :)

Stay safe out there. The waters can be rough.
