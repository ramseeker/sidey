I have been searching high and low trying to find how I can easily write and blog without getting bogged down with  **distraction free** editors and other fluff. I  don't need an IDE and yet some  simple text editors are just too...well, simple. 

I write in markdown  so I want to be able to have a few keyboard shortcuts at my ready to make my writing just a bit easier but text editors don't have markdown shortcuts (usually) and IDE's are just plain overkill. 

Up until now, I hadn't found anything I liked but after some searching this evening I think I have found my new writing software. It's [Mark Text](http://marktext.com) and  it works well and even allows me to easily add images too.

If all goes well, when I publish this, you should see a photo of some pancakes. If this happens  then I have found my new workflow.
