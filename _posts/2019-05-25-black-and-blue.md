If at first you don't succeed..well, you know the rest. 

I was trying to create a site earlier today with [wordpress](wordpress.org) and was having a heck of a time getting [vaultpress](http://vaultpress.com) to work right so I gave up and went for walk and decided to stick with [Jekyll](http://jekryllrb.com) as my publishing tool of choice. 

One reason I wanted to use wordpress was because I thought it might be easier as once you have it setup all you really have to do is write a title, the post and add an image or two and you're good to go. But as I have [written before](https://jim.am/back-to-jekyll/) I really like using Jekyll once I get my mind wrapped around how [static site generators](http://www.staticgen.com) work as it reminds me of creating sites in the old days with just a text editor and some html. 

So, once I decided that wordpress was out of the running and that for better or worse, I was stuck with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) I decided to have another stab at designing the site I really wanted, and I have to tell you **[it's really ugly](https://jim.am/on-ugly-sites/)** and I am totally okay with that. 

My new site has white background, **zero** images and black text with HTML links as the standard blue. It could not be more boring if I tried. And that's a good thing. 

I have no sharing buttons, related posts or any other crap - just content that I hope will be of use to somebody as much as  it is to me. I've also changed my mindset some. Where I would once chase the money and made many crappy sites trying to do so  - this little side hustle is **fun** and I think that's more important. Would it be nice if I made a dollar or two? Sure, but I want to add a lot more content and value before I worry about monetizing this. 

I'm happy with the day's efforts and that's all I could ask. I tried again and I won this time.
