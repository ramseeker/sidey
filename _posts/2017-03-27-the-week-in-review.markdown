It’s hard to believe that it’s been a week [since my last post](http://jim.am/it-snowed-this-week/) but a lot of stuff can happen in a week so let’s recap:




## Some Snow Melted

_(note parking brake on dog)_




A week ago I **called in sick** (sick of winter) 2 days in a row because we got walloped with almost 2 feet of the stuff:

And now, hardly anything left




## More Signs of Spring




It’s muddy paw season here:

I hate muddy paw season, because no matter how much you try the dig still manages to track stuff into the house. Spring Cleaning over and over and over again. (sigh)




# I Saw a Chevy Bolt




I told BW I was going to come home with one (I kid. I like living indoors)

They are smaller than I thought they would be. They’re nice looking but I don’t really understand why all car manufacturers that make electric cars make them to look more like concept cars than actual …well, cars.




Tesla’s electric car looks pretty normal, but it’s also too rich for our blood. If you want an interior with a lot of plastic then this is the car for you.




## I Got Fingerprinted




_Mom would be so proud._




Actually, this is a good thing. I’m applying for citizenship and getting fingerprinted is part of the process. I was in and out in 15 minutes.




Now, I wait for an appointment for an interview to open up. In the meantime I’ve got some civics questions to study for my exam.




## Another Year Older




Happy Birthday to meeeee……..

My favorite mother in law drove all the way to Buffalo to bake me a birtday pie (blueberry!) and also gifted me with a card for Target that I used to stock up on clothes. It’s kind of hard to beat a 2 dollar t-shirt on sale. I’m a good little shopper.




and BW bought me a cake from [Wegmans](http://www.wegmans.com) and had it waiting for me after work with  a cup of tea.




_(BW doesn’t bake because it’s safer for us that way)_

So, all in all a pretty busy week and a pretty good week. After last week’s snow storm any week without 2 feet of snow is a good one.




Also, there was pie (and cake!)
