For more than an year know, BW has been asking me to move my red couch from my bachelor days that’s been sitting in the basement since I got here - to her office at work.




I’ve been blowing this task off for some time for a few reasons: the first is I like that couch. That couch and I have a history. But then I realized it’s just a crappy couch from IKEA so whatever. I need to get over it.




The excuse I have been using for YEARS is that it’s too big and for a long time, BW bought my excuse. But when the topic came up this time, I actually went out to the Honda and measured. It should fit.




and spoiler alert: it does. There goes my excuse.




BW and I managed to wrangle it out of the basement into the car and then out of the car and into her office.




We could not have done this without Amanda’s hand cart. Who is Amanda you ask? Read on dear reader…




Years back, my Dad (Hi Dad!) was following a truck and this hand cart fell out of it. So Dad stopped on the side of the road and picked up Amanda’s Cart and now it’s the family cart. I guess I was the last to move with this cart and so now it’s here in the good ol US of A.




We know it’s Amanda’s Cart because on the back of it is written:




**Amanda’s - Do not move or I will cut your…..off. **




Amanda doesn’t sound very nice.




But the good news is that I have dodged this fate for another day because BW has a red leather couch in her office and I have a happy wife.




Amanda? She’s still looking for her cart.
