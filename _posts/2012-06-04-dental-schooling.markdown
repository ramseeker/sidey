It started with me losing my glasses, and today of all days too. I had an appointment. In the morning. I had look quasi respectable and couldn’t just bounce around in jeans and a sweatshirt as is the norm around here. And  I could not find my glasses for the life of me (I had hid them on myself absentmindedly - you’d think I were the professor).




Nope, today I had a first-thing-in-the-morning appointment with the periodontist and I’ll save you all the details but the bottom line from my appointment was two-fold:






  1. 



It’s gonna hurt






  1. 



It’s gonna hurt the wallet. A lot. Insurance only goes so far.




And to top it off the dentist was an egotistical and arrogant sort. My Dentist warned me when he referred me:  ”He’s arrogant, but he’s good”. This guy lived up to my expectations. But he sounds like he knows what he’s talking about so…here I go - the fun starts in August




**And Just Like That… **




When I had written off today as a really crappy day** [I  got reminded what’s important](http://jim.am/3-months/)  **and it’s not money or crappy appointments or lost glasses as that’s just the everyday. B called me in to look at facebook (she was working hard as you can see) and our excellent photographer posted some wedding photos and then just hours later this arrived in the mail:

These were even more photos taken by a good family friend. Not only are they wonderful photos but they came in this beautiful satchel that was hand made and has sentimental value. Also included was a very generous wedding gift. Thank You.




More importantly this reminded me that the good days, the bad days, and the in-between days are so much better with B. Period.




PS> Stay tuned for tomorrow. It will be good - trust me.  Well worth the price of admission.




PPS> I still don’t like [eggplant](http://jim.am/the-hot-water-heater-fund/).
