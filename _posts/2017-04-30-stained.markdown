I wish there was a way to explain this week, but there really isn’t.




You see it started when BW saw this on our downstairs coffee table:

and then just a few days later, this:

This ladies and gents is BW’s **jesus on toast moment** and when I don’t think it will get any weirder it does.




I thought it was kind of weird when BW was screaming at the top of her lungs and that I should get downstairs pronto. I ran downstairs thinking something was really wrong, but nope, just the fact that she saw stains on our ten dollar coffee table.




But how else could you explain all this stuff? It must be the second coming or maybe it’s just a spot where I put my second cup of coffee on the table but either way pretty freaky.




moving on..




## Just Call Me Julia Child




I have been **cooking**. Let’s wait a minute and let that sink in a bit. I mean real cooking too and not just some spaghetti with a can of sauce either. I mean, take a look at this beauty I made:

Looks pretty good, yes?




If you’re wondering what happened let me tell you that this was not planned. But the other day BW was leafing through some fliers and she found one for [Hello Fresh ](https://www.hellofresh.com/)and went to the computer to investigate.




It turns out that we could not figure out how to use the website and pick the meals so we got frustrated and researched and found[ blue apron](https://www.blueapron.com/) instead




After doing some math, we figured that this might be a way to eat a bit healthier and I’m pretty good at following directions (I have been married for over five years after all) so how hard could this be?




It’s also beneficial that I am the one that’s the instruction follower instead of the instruction giver as that means the cooking can be a bit more equitable around here.




Also, we had a coupon.




So our first week with 3 meals has been a success. We have had:




### An Asian Dish

### Mole Chili

and




### Pan Seared Cod with Olive Hash

And as a bonus the folks at blue apron included an extra recipe where you have to get your own ingredients but if you include that then that’s 4 dinners for the week. Add to the fact that BW and I don’t eat together every day and this works out pretty well for our week. We cut back on grocery shopping for meals so this doesn’t really add to our cost of eating.




There’s a few reasons why we like blue apron:






  1. 


BW thinks I’m a hero that now I can cook





  2. 


Portion Control. There’s no seconds.





  3. 


2 pans, tops. These are not all that complicated and are easy to clean up afterwards.





  4. 


Less waste. You don’t have to buy a jug of some sauce because some recipe calls for a 1/4 teaspoon. Blue apron supplies you with just enough of what you need so there’s not orphaned and lost ingredients in your fridge later.







and not only am I cooking but..




## BW is Baking. Cakes.




As we have discussed here before BW and baking usually ends up in a 911 call so it’s to both of our surprise that we not only get to eat cake but that we still have a house to eat said cake in and it hasn’t been burned down. Just look at this beauty:




![image alt text](/public/4SmpqPtkUQOC0XwEirF6bg_img_6.jpg)




Looks pretty good, right? Now the bad news is you **must like lemon cake** as this is all that BW does but hey we’re off to a start.




### You Want How Much?




We’re getting a new front porch installed because the one we currently have is in pretty bad shape.




![image alt text](/public/4SmpqPtkUQOC0XwEirF6bg_img_7.jpg)




So a few weeks ago I called the[ unit step guy ](http://unitstepprecast.com/)and once I recovered from the price he quoted I arranged to have a new front porch installed and it’s getting there and we have the foundation poured. The guys should come back next week and finish the job once the concrete pad they poured is finished.




Let’s just say it’s a good thing we’re cooking our own meals because this stuff ain’t cheap. The computers I could own… sigh




To wrap up I want to share one last thing:




## The Dog Had a Sports Injury




![image alt text](/public/4SmpqPtkUQOC0XwEirF6bg_img_8.jpg)




At least that’s what we found out at the vet and $175 later. The spring weather brings ball chasing and with it, the dog sprained a muscle. We can’t have a limping dog so she’s been on muscle relaxers and judging by how little she has moved they seemed to be very relaxing.




And that wraps it up for this week’s episode. It’s not written in stone but it seems like Sundays are a good night to write here.




Have a good week!




Tidy Husband and Co.
