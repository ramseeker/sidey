After some time trying to find a [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) workflow for jim.am I’ve decided to go back to using wordpress.




Simply put, it’s just easier. It was a learning process to be sure but I found I spent more time tweaking and screwing around with themes or troubleshooting different and cryptic error messages in [github pages](http://pages.github.com) when I should actually be working.  The speed of a static jekyll site is like no other and it was kind of cool having your [content hosted by google ](http://firebase.com) but in the end I found wordpress works better for me as it allows me to grab a device - any device - and start writing.




The disadvantage is that hosting jekyll was free whereas this costs me a few dollars a month for [GoDaddy managed hosting](http://godaddy.com) but I can live with it. The advantages of wordpress vs jekyll, for me anyway lean towards wordpress for the time being.




I have picked a simple theme and I’m ready to start writing more and tweaking less.
