If there's one thing I have learned in my old age is that **you should ask** for stuff.

Ask for a deal, ask for better, ask for a raise. As a (somewhat) introverted this can be hard but a lot of times not a whole lot of people want to say no to you and the end result is that you end up getting what you want.

A recent example: A screw in our [high chair](https://jim.am/high-chair/) fell out. At first I thought I would just go to the hardware store and find a replacement but due to the pandemic, going outside to get a screw wasn't the best choice.

So I emailed the manufacturer and asked if they had any extras. They did. One is on the way for free.

I don't know if [this chair](https://amzn.to/34xN9fn) has a warranty of any kind, but it should. It was close to $150.00 so one would think it would last more than a year without parts falling out, but maybe they didn't test against a rambunctious toddler like mine and didn't expect screws to wiggle out of the thing.

Anyway, new screw on the way. For Free. Because I asked.
