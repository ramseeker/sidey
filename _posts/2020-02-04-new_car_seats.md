I had written a post about this already, but I haven't an idea where it went so I am trying again. 

I was on a roll too, I wrote 2 [days](https://jim.am/talking-cookie-jar/) in a [row](https://jim.am/lusso_gear_car_seat_protector/) and yet now  I have to start over again in my daily writing challenge.

Right, car seats:

Now that she's **1 YEAR OLD!** we had to buy these as she ws getting too big for the other [smaller one we had](https://amzn.to/3749kcV) and this seemed, well... fine. 

I didn't really spend a lot of time searching for a car seat as all I needed one that looked okay for her and was a name brand (Graco) that we liked.  A very small discussion about what color we should get and before you know it we ordered 2 of these in "Gotham" Color. It doesn't matter anyway about the color because there is going to be lots of spills and stains on this thing in no time. 

We paid about $140.00 each and I see now that at time of writing they are closer to $180 on Amazon but prices will change on Amazon all the time so it doesn't really matter the price. A year from now it won't matter what we paid for these car seats. 

### The Review 
Not really a review, but after reading the very confusing instruction manual about how to install these, the reality was that these were actully pretty easy to install. 

If you have a car that's made in the last decade or even later you don't have to worry about using seat belts and just click the seat to the hooks at the back of the seat in the car. Make sure the seat is level and that the strap to the car is tight and you're good to go. 

This is not the worst car seats still a car seat and you have to somehow shove a wiggly (and sometimes back-arching)
toddler and then find the strap, only to find that it's been twisted to bits. When you think you are finished, you have to find the buckle which is now **under** your toddler. 

So, ya. Car seats are fun. The good news is we only have to strap her in for [another 7 years](https://dmv.ny.gov/more-info/safety-restraints)
