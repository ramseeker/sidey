# Mac Mini Prices




Expect to pay from about $499.00 and up for a brand new Mac Mini from Apple in 2016.




The Mac Mini (the current one) comes from Apple in the following configurations:




## $499.00




1.4GHz dual-core Intel Core i5  

4GB memory  

500GB hard drive1  

Intel HD Graphics 5000




## $699.00




2.6GHz dual-core Intel Core i5  

8GB memory  

1TB hard drive  

Intel Iris Graphics




## $999.00




2.8GHz dual-core Intel Core i5  

8GB memory  

1TB Fusion Drive  

Intel Iris Graphics




The [cheapest Mac Mini you can buy today](http://amzn.to/2fKARXH%5C) is $499.00 as a new unit but you may be able to find it cheaper as refurbished model. (as well as the other configurations) Check for refurbished Macs [here](http://www.apple.com/shop/browse/home/specialdeals/mac)




The other models offer faster processors, more RAM and in some cases: **fusion drives**. The last feature is really what you should consider as the most important feature if you want a faster Mac Mini.




The starter model comes from Apple with a spinning 500GB hard drive and it’s a shame because prices on SSD storage has dropped considerably and if Apple had equipped this with even a 128GB ssd (the maximum on most phones) then they would have had a very nice desktop mac with very nice features at a very nice price.




But currently you need to spend another $200 to get the 2.66Ghz Mac Mini and then you are close to spending one thousand dollars on a desktop Mac with a SSD drive which is **another** $200 upgrade. This  begs the question: maybe you should buy a PC instead? Or perhaps just switch to an Apple notebook like the MacBook Air which includes portability and a display keyboard and touchpad too.




Power Users will want the $999.00 model which is a bit faster and inludes the fusion drive as standard but at a thousand dollars is the Mac Mini a deal when you compare it to other small format desktop computers?




I guess that last question is up to you but if you’re looking at the  **cheapest apple computer you can buy** you’re looking at spending **at least ** $$500 for the base configuration
