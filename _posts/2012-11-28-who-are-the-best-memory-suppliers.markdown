When buying memory online there’s a few things to consider before you place your online memory order and they are:






  * 


**RAM Type **Laptop or Desktop memory?





  * 


**Budget **How much can you afford?





  * 


**Brand Name or Generic **Do you need affordable memory or can you pay a little more for brand name?





  * 


**Store Reputation **There’s more than one memory store I would not recommend at all.





  * 


**Shipping Cost **Some offer free shipping and others don’t.





  * 


**Shipping Speed **How fast do you need your memory





  * 


**Stock.** Does the memory store stock the ram you need





  * 


**Easy to Find.** Some online memory stores make it impossible to find anything





  * 


**Reviews **What do others think about the store ([reseller ratings is a great resource](http://www.resellerratings.com))





  * 


**Warranty** What if something goes wrong with your memory
