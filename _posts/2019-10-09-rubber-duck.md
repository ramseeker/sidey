Our [first bath toy](https://amzn.to/2OzENxM) arrived today and of course, it's a **rubber duck**

I hadn't really planned on buying her a rubber duck quite yet but I was out and about looking for a [swimsuit for me](https://amzn.to/2AVmyL9) and I saw this and considering it was [less than three dollars](https://amzn.to/2OzENxM) I figured: what the heck. 

And boy oh boy, is it a hit. If I had known she would have enjoyed this duck so much I would have done this long ago. It's her favorite toy and considering I should be able to get a few years of use out of the rubber duck then it's just pennies a month for some entertainment in the bath.

She's also getting too big for the [baby bathtub](https://amzn.to/2IBzR82) we have for her and we only bought it in June! The next tub I guess will be something like [this](https://amzn.to/2VsCbDf) but it's another $30 so we will hold off for a few weeks. It seems we just get an item for her and she outgrows it!

Case in point: This [Tiny Love Mobile](https://amzn.to/2VwigDI) cost us $24.00 and now that she outgrew it I thought I would try and sell it on eBay but I only ended up getting two dollars for it! Had I known, I would have just donated it to the [Goodwill](http://goodwill.com)  

So there you have it. If you're looking to buy a rubber duck for your little one it's [highly recommended](https://amzn.to/2OzENxM).
