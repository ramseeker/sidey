I did it. I managed to write a post here **every day** for a month.

At the start it wasn't easy. But, it's getting easier so I thought about what I have learned so far.

  1. You have to make the time. Nobody is going to help you with this. If it's important enough to you, you **will** find the time.
  2. It gets easier
  3. It doesn't really matter what you write.
  

If I had to give one piece of advice it would be number 3. Just start. Write about your kid, your shoe collection your [new lawnmower](https://jim.am/new-cordless-mower/) or whatever else. Eventually you will figure it out. The trick to become a writer (which is kind of the goal here) is to write.

For too long I spent buying wordpress themes and expensive hosting and getting things **all set up** and then I wouldn't actually  stick with it or I would spend more time tweaking than writing. I had it backwards. This time around I am using the [simplest blogging format](http://jekyllrb.com) and one of the [plainest themes](http://getpoole.com) and I get to it.

I write with a [Chromebook](https://amzn.to/2YvWcfT) so I use the fantastic [caret](https://thomaswilburn.net/caret/) text editor to write and it does the trick.

For the photos, I grab a free one from [Pexels](http://www.pexels.com) and I'm off to the races.

I build my site, and upload it to my webhost and I'm done.

All this takes me about 15 minutes. I guarantee I have spent more time today on [reddit](http://www.reddit.com) than writing, so I still have some way to go but for me I put on my headphones and I get to it. I usually don't have any idea what I am going to write about until I start to write but I would like to be able to get a few draft posts ready.

I figure I might as well take advantage of the stay at home orders and do **something** productive other than following my toddler around trying to keep her out of trouble. And in a way, this writing is good stress relief too. It's good to get your thoughts down - even if nobody reads them.

This site is **for me** first and foremost and if you get some enjoyment out of it great, but this isn't about 'building a brand' or whatever hot blogging strategy is these days. I'm just happy watching my cursor fly across the screen.

Now the trick will be to see if I can continue for **another 30 days**
