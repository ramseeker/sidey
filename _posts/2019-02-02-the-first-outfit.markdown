I went to see SP today in the NICU and she had borrowed some pink outfit from one of her friends to wear today. I guess I already failed parenting because I assumed that she was good with just a diaper in her 29 degree C  'isolette'. 







But it seems they can wear clothes in there and that's a good thing because we have a [bunch of clothes waiting for her](https://jim.am/carters-onesies/). When I go see her tomorrow I will be sure to bring a little outfit for her to change into. 







I missed the changing and the feeding as BW was there at the hospital earlier today than I could get there because: work, but soon I want to be able to change her. BW can't have all the fun. :)
