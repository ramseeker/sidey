It’s an older model but it still has a fair bit of ram at 4GB and you can [upgrade the RAM to 8GB](http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_odkw=8gb+macbook+ram&_osacat=175673&_from=R40&_trksid=p2045573.m570.l1313.TR0.TRC0.H0.XMC516LL+ram.TRS1&_nkw=MC516LL+ram&_sacat=175673) for about $50.00 or less to max out the ram on this 13 inch white Macbook.




The drive is okay, but it’s a spinning drive so you might see some benefit from a SSD drive.[ A 250GB ssd is about $100. ](http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_odkw=MC516LL+ram&_osacat=175673&_from=R40&_trksid=p2045573.m570.l1313.TR8.TRC1.A0.H0.X250gb+ssd.TRS0&_nkw=250gb+ssd&_sacat=175673)




The big question would be is it worth it to upgrade this computer further?




Chances are you will also need a new battery and then you’re looking at about $400.00 plus for a Mac that’s discontinued long ago. You might also need a battery and this would cost [another twenty bucks](http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_odkw=2009+macbook+white+battery&_osacat=0&_from=R40&_trksid=p2045573.m570.l1313.TR1.TRC0.A0.H0.XMC516LL%2FA++battery.TRS0&_nkw=MC516LL%2FA++battery&_sacat=0) or so too




This one does come in the original box and seems to be in good shape.
