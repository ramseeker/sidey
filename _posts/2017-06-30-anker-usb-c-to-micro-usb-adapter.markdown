This two pack of USB-C to USB-A adapters are another way to convert and use legacy (read: anything not usb-c) devices such as thumb drives. The benefit of these over cables is that they are cheap enough that you can leave them on your thumb drives, etc so you don’t have to worry about finding that dongle you had.
