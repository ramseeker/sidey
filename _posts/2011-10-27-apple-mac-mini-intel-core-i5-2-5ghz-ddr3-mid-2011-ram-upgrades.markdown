**Apple Mac Mini Intel Core i5 2.5Ghz DDR3 – Mid- 2011**




[![Cheapest Mac Mini Needs RAM](http://www.jim.am/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-Shot-2011-07-28-at-1.32.41-PM.png)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YLCLM6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ramseeker-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399373&creativeASIN=B004YLCLM6)




The Apple Mac mini was an innovative attempt to tap into the consumer market with an entry level Mac desktop computer. The Mac mini is remarkable for its small size as well as the fact that it comes with no display, keyboard or mouse—and after its initial introduction, no built in optical drive. Apple promoted this as BYOKDM (aka “Bring Your Own…” and was aimed at users who might already have these compatible peripherals to justify the lower cost.




The original Mac Mini did not include a server version but did have an optical drive. Going forward from the first Mac mini revision in the summer of 2010, all versions of the mini included the server version as part of the Mac OS X operating system, the 2011 configurations eliminated the optical drive.




The Apple Mac mini Intel Core i5 2.5 GHz features the aluminum unibody design that replaced the original chassis which featured a polycarbonate top and bottom panels on the aluminum case. The unit measures 7.7 inches (19.7 cm) square and 1.4 inches (3.6 cm) tall. It weighs 2.7 pounds (1.22 kg). The processor that shipped with the computer was a 2.5GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 with 3MB on-chip shared L3 cache, custom configurable to 2.7GHz dual-core Intel Core i7.
