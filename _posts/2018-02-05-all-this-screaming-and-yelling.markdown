My mission today: find a way for BW to watch the Super Bowl -  preferably for free.




It turns out you can watch it for free with the Amazon fire stick.




So…BW is downstairs yelling at the TV. As I write this at half-time her team is winning.




I think.




She’s the sports fan, not me. I like the commercials.

As it’s getting late and there’s still another half of this,  I’m not going to wait up and see how this all ends as I have my [own team to cheer on. ](http://tigercats.ca)
