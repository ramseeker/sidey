I’ve switched to using this theme for jim.am as it’s a very nice and simple theme. There are a lot of simple themes out there when I was using  [jekyll, ](http://jekyllrb.com) but not so much for wordpress, where they all seemed to be overkill for those of that want just a simple and lightweight theme.




The story of [how this theme came to be](https://anguswoodman.com/new-look-is-born/) is great too.
