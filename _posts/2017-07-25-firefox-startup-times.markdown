This is interesting, and kind of makes me want to have another look at firefox again for Â a browser. There was a time when the first thing you did to a new computer was to install firefox.




<blockquote>[![](https://jim.am/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/startup.png)](https://metafluff.com/2017/07/21/i-am-a-tab-hoarder/)I took my 1691 tab browser profile, and did a wall-clock measurement of start-up time and memory use for Firefox versions 20, 30, 40, and 50 through 56.These are my personal results. You might not get the same results. If you test 1691 (or even 1692) tabs and find something totally different, I'd love to hear about it.
