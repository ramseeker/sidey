It's nice when it works.

I usually sell stuff via [eBay](http://www.ebay.com) and have had over 1000 transactions and have been a member for 23 years (!!) and I have bought and thousands and thousands of dollars of stuff without much trouble.

And of course, the **one time** I didn't sell on eBay and left a package on the porch [USPS](http://usps.com) lets me down!

The other day I sold an item via reddit to another user. I know there's scams and the like but this is a pretty specific item the fellow wanted to buy and I had one I wasn't using much so I sent a note that I had one. We worked out a price, he paid via [Paypal](http://paypal.com) and would be good.

Last night I printed a shipping label and arranged to have USPS pick it up when they drop off the mail. By staying home, I'm doing my duty to stay home and save lives. Usually, I prefer to drop off my packages in person, but these are strange times so I do my best to help.

In the morning, I put the package on the porch for pickup and notice about lunchtime it's gone so I assume it's been picked up and all good, yes?

Of course, **this is the package** that for whatever reason doesn't get scanned or there's no tracking information for.  That means I have no idea if and when it gets delivered. Sigh. I usually get a confirmation email that they have picked up the package or at least I have a tracking number, but not this time.

This is not a big problem at all and the worse case is that I'm out a bit of money and life goes. But still, I would have loved to have this **one package** delivered without fail, but that does not seem to be the case.

There's a small chance that the package was stolen in the 3 hours it was on the porch, but I kind of doubt it as I live in a pretty quiet neighborhood even without the pandemic and with it- it's even quieter.

I hope this is just a ghost in the machine and it will all work out in the end. Compared to other things going on, the fact that I don't have a tracking number seems rather small, but sometimes it's the small things that bug you the most.

And this bugs me.
