BW decided that our christmas tree just didn’t look right without a star on the top  so once again the Amazon guy was at our door this week. The tree is  leaning to the right a bit but I think it’s our very own version of the charlie brown tree.




A star is all we both get this christmas as we gave ourselves an early holiday present of a dry basement once again. The plumbing outside the house had to be dug up with a jackhammer outside the house and then repaired by 2 plumbers. It’s always a special holiday feeling when there’s  two plumbing service trucks parked outside the house.
