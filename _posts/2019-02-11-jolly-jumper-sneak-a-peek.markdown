All these cutesy named products I didn't know existed until [she came alongÂ ](https://jim.am/shes-here/)and now they are arriving fast and furious. One of the latest to arrive at our doorstep is a [cover for the baby seat. ](https://amzn.to/2WQmEh7)

I bought this vs other car seat covers because it was priced [just over $20.00](https://amzn.to/2WQmEh7) compared to the other colors that at the time were priced at almost twice as much so it was a no-brainer. 







Apparently these are great when carrying the baby around in the car seat in the winter as the baby is still easy to get to, but it keeps the child warm and is much easier to manage than a plain blanket thrown over the car seat which can slip and be a trip hazard. 







The model I bought is fleece lined and seems to be well designed. I haven't tried it out yet because SP is still in the NICU but I hope by the end of the month I can bring her home where she belongs.
