If the fever wasn't enough, now the little one has a [rash](https://www.healthline.com/health/rashes) to deal with. Due to the [coronavirus](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/symptoms.html) our pediatrician is not seeing patients at all and the  best I can get from them is to use their 'portal' to email them, which sucks because it's **really hard** to explain how a rash looks. 

Anyway, it started a few days ago but it was isolated to a small part of her back and looked just a spot of dry skin so I thought 'meh' whatever. But yesterday it really blossomed to be an entire rash over her back that was growing up her neckline and behind her ears. 

Thankfully, even with the crappy portal we did her back from the pediatrician and they suggested hydrocortisone cream and after an overnight I have to say that the **rash looks better**. Not great, but better. I hope with some more applications of cream she'll be back to normal in no time. 

Also, it looks like most of the fever has broken for the ladies in the house so that's a good thing too. Now all we need to do is survive the stay at home orders. 

Be safe.
