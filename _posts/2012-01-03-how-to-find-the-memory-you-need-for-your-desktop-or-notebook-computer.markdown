here’s not a day goes by where I’m not asked the question:




**What kind of RAM do I need? What RAM and Memory Upgrades Should I Buy?**




**[Apple MacBook Pro. Best Selling NoteBook Today](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ramseeker-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I)**




![Best laptop](http://www.jim.am/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Screen-shot-2011-03-26-at-2.24.37-PM.png)Well, that depends. On the PC side of the memory equation you usually have more options and it’s easier to** find out what kind of memory you need for your computer** as the manufacturer and models names for the desktop and notebook computers are distinct for each computer manufacturer and model.




For example, If you  are looking to** upgrade your del**l, and you have a **dell notebook** you need memory upgrades for all you usually have to do is find out what model number that is and you’re usually off to the races. For an example: **You need memory for your brand new Dell inspiron 14  or Inspiron 15 or even inspiron 17 models with core i3 and core i5 processors **that are **current notebook models from Dell**, but would perform much better if you just **added more memory.** (as adding memory to most computers will offer: more ram equals faster software)




Right, so you’ve got the model name from Dell:  So you find any[**memory store** ](http://www.jim.am)that you choose and each of these stores will offer a **memory configurator **where you just plunk in your manufacturer and model name of your** desktop or notebook **and you’re returned with a list of **memory & ram upgrades** that match your computer.




Sounds Easy, Right? And it is: For this example, I’ll use[**Crucial Technology**](http://amzn.to/2oA2gjC)**,** but you could pick from any **vendor of memory** I list on [ramseeker](http://www.jim.am) as they all carry easy to use** memory configurators that will help you choose the right memory** and ram upgrades.




But for this example, I’ll use[ Crucial Technology](http://amzn.to/2oA2gjC): So I find my manufacturer: Which is in this case, Dell. And then I’ll choose **Inspiron laptops/notebooks,** and then lastly I find my model, for this example I will use Dell Inspiron 15 and I see theres’s two choices: One is just Dell inspiron 15, and the other  is **dell inspiron 1564**, The **dell inspiron 15** seems  to list a  little older types of memory  and I’m going go guess that the** dell inspiron 15 (1564) **is the better choice for me as this model listing at crucial specifies** DDR3 PC1066 memory modules **which is the more recent of the two listings and also a quick reference of the dell website specifies that the **dell inspiron 15  that’s currently offered does require the DD3 PC-8500 memory modules**.




And that’s it.  A bit of research, and I’ve got a **new ram and memory upgrade ordered for my Dell Inspiron 15 notebook** computer.
