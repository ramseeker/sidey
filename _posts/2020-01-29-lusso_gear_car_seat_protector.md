This is the latest aquisition for her. It's a [car seat protector](https://amzn.to/2S1lFc7) for protecting the car seat from the car seat.

I know, confusing.

What's not confusing is the fact that this sells for just about $25.00 ([check price](https://amzn.to/2S1lFc7+)) so it's not that much money.

I only bought one of these as even though we have 2 cars we  only have one car we really care about as the other car is the 2nd car and altough hanging in there has seen better day s.

I figure for $25.00 it was not that of a purchase and I hope it protects a bit from spills, but if it doesn't then at least I tried.

Besides, who has time to cry over spilled milk?
