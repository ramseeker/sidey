That’s great that you need the best ram upgrade for iMac but the very first thing we need to do is figure out which apple iMac you use. Maybe you already know this as some apple  fans and websites have a lot of knowledge about all the different types of iMacs and not just ram so if you’ve come with the knowledge of what ram you need for your particular iMac feel free to skip ahead and start to [shop for iMac Memory now](http://www.jim.am).




I track and monitor memory prices on a whole bunch of different iMacs over the years and Apple has this annoying  habit of just calling the iMac ‘iMac’ regardless of year or design. They’re all just iMacs according to Apple and the latest is the ‘iMac’ model that was just released. This has been called different names to differentiate between the older models. I have seen the new iMac as iMac Summer 2010 or iMac mid July or if you’re me I classify the Apple iMacs by ram types they use.If you’re looking for the **[best ram upgrade for iMac ](http://www.jim.am)**you’ve definitely come to the right place.




**[Best Apple iMac Prices](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8IO6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ramseeker-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002QQ8IO6)**




But for the rest of us: a little lesson on how to find out what  iMac you have, or at very least I want to help you figure out what RAM you need for iMacs. Here’s how and this technique will work not only with iMacs but with  MacBooks or any other apple computer too.




Go to your apple menu in the left hand corner.




Select: About this Mac




Up comes a window that tells you how much RAM you have and how to see what RAM  you need.




Here’s mine: It’s a MacBook. I know this because apple has screen printed it right on the screen for me to see – nice and handy.




 




It will show the processor speed. This is good and in my case I have a MacBook Pro 2.4Ghz. I’ll write this down.




Then I see I have 4GB of RAM installed already (which is the maximum already). And this ram runs at 1067mhz., which is real close to the 1066Mhz RAM I need to buy ( apple rounds up the speed of the memory. My MacBook pro ram runs at 1066.6 Mhz , so apple calls it close enough to 1067MHz)




In my case I know know I have a MacBook Pro 2.4GHz and it runs at 1066Mhz, so if I were to shop for ram for my MacBook  I would want to buy MacBook Pro 1066Mhz RAM




And that’s all there is to it to find out how much ram  you have. If you need help figuring any of this out be sure to contact me and I’ll be happy to help you get the best RAM upgrade for your iMac or any computer.
