It’s Pie Day!




![](http://jim.am/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/null-20.jpeg)




Is this country great, or what?




I stopped at our [favorite grocery store](https://www.wegmans.com/) to pickup some things on the way home from work and there was a big sign that said **happy pi day (**because it’s March 14) but I thought they meant it’s **PIE DAY** so of course being a brand new American citizen I had to celebrate accordingly.




Because what’s more American than eating Apple Pie on Pie Day? I’m just doing my part. (or, slice).
