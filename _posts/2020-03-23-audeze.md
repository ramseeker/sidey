I wonder if it’s worth it to have a pair of headphones that are worth this much. It seems like it’s a **lot** of  money for these headphones. Granted they are an esoteric brand and not [a pair of beats headphones](https://amzn.to/2UwWj7d) that are another brand that are overrated for what they are..

I think the diminishing rate of return starts about that $500 dollar mark and anything over that you are starting to pay for what you think *might* be better sounding cans.
