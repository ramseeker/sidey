Determining what [DDR3 RAM](http://amzn.to/2oA2gjC) you need for your Apple Macintosh computer is really not all that difficult as Apple lists technical specifications for all [current shipping Macs](http://www.apple.com/mac/) on their website which will help you find the correct DDR3 memory for new Apple Computers such as Apple iMac, Apple MacBook Pro, Apple MacBook and Mac Pro and Mac Mini computer models.




If you’re looking to upgrade a now discontinued apple computer there’s a good chance that DDR3 memory is not the correct memory you need anyway, as except for a few recently discontinued Apple computers like the [discontinued Apple iMac](http://www.jim.am/memory/iMac_(DDR3_1066)/) that until mid summer 2010 was a current Apple iMac model most older computers from Apple require either DDR1 or even just DDR memory to run. If you do need to upgrade RAM on non-DDR3 Apple computers I suggest you visit [Low End Mac](http://www.lowendmac.com) which has specifications on memory and more for every mac ever made.




Now that we’ve determined that you do need to [buy DDR3 RAM for Mac](http://www.jim.am) the next question to get asked is where to buy Apple Memory and from whom? I’ve put together a little list of [Apple Memory Stores](http://www.jim.am/where-to-buy-computer-memory-upgrades/) where you can use to find a third party memory store that suits your needs when shopping for DDR3 RAM.




Usually, the next step after you have determined which DDR3 RAM you need and where you might like to buy DDR3 RAM from is price. It’s only natural to want to save money on memory upgrades, regardless of memory type and again, I have compiled some data on DDR3 RAM prices for Apple Computers:
