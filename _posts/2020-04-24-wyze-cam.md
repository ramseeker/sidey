When I bought this little [$25.00 wireless camera](https://amzn.to/3eQQJ9h) I didn't have a child so this was really just an impulse buy one weekend when the wife was away and I wanted to set it up in the living room to watch the dog while I was out.
 
News flash: The dog slept on the carpet. **a lot**

Anyway, the camera. If you bought it to keep an eye on the dog, it works. But as a **kid watcher** this thing is awesome.

Not only can I keep an eye on my little one sleeping in her crib while I'm down in my man cave writing. I have an old [Amazon Fire Tablet](https://amzn.to/3eNOdk3) that I wasn not using anymore so it has become my dedicated machine to watch the kiddo while I play downstairs at night.

I mostly use it as a kiddo watcher machine with the sound off, because if she's screaming she's awake and I can **see** that she's awake but there's times when the sound is handy too such as when you want to be **sure she's asleep** before you  go watch that movie on [netflix](http://netflix.com)

This thing has a lot of functions I don't use, and I should really read the manual again to see if I'm missing anything but for what I use it for, it allows me to see her sleeping in her crib at night and there's no nicer sight after a long day in lockdown than to see your child at sleep at last :)
