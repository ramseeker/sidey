It's not the idea of writing I have a hard time with it's the **actual writing** that is the killer for me. I'm sure it is for a lot of others and it's good to know I am not alone but still. **What to write?**  

Im not that interesting to gain a following for this blog just on the basis of my writing as this is new skill for me, that I am trying to hone over time. But as it stands now I don't have a very big audience for all the effort I have put into this site. https://jekyllthemes.io/jekyll-blog-themes

I would definitely make **more** as a barista at [starbucks](https://starbucks.com) than I could by writing and yet I enjoy writing. 

Maybe that's all I need - the fact that I like to write. I don't like the fact that I can't type well and I am **sure** of the fact that I use too many commans but when it's quiet and I  get into the 'zone' of writing it's a very enjoyable thing to do - and pretty cheap too. You could write on pretty much any device or even if you wanted to go old school and paper and pen there's that option too. 

Anyway, back to what to write about? And I think that it will end up being **whatever I want**. 

The internet marketer in me wants to makes lists of stuff with lots of affiliate links but I don't think that this is the best idea and I'm pretty boring with the day to day stuff - at least I think so - but then again, maybe not. 

Perhaps the trick is to do a little bit of everything and then see what works and what doesn't. It's early days for me yet as I have six years to get to a million words. (I figure I might as well give myself some time) 

Assuming I need to write 600,000 words that means I need to write 100,000 words a year or approx 300 words a day. 

I think 300 words a day is a very reasonable goal as it's really just a few paragraphs and you're done 

At least that's the plan. We shall see.
