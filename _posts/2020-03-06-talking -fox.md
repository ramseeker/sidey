This might be the new favorite toy for the little one. There's other more complicated ones to be sure but this little stuffed animal seems to be a hit.

If you press it's belly it will record and repeat what you say to it. She's a litle too young to figure it out yet and she talks to it **without** pressing the tummy but that's okay because we really don't need another toy talking to us in the house.

The fox is priced about $20.00 if you need to buy your own. [check price](https://amzn.to/2wwbchZ)
