It's been 3 weeks and 1 day since we left the house other than for food or pharmacy and like many in this country we're going a little bit **stir crazy** with a one-year old in the house but I think I may have found the solution: **the afternoon nap**

It really has become [groundhog day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundhog_Day_(film)) around here as we the same thing at the same time **every freaking day** without fail pretty much.

A day right now looks like this:

Sleep until she says you have to get up. (about 7) and then figure out how pants work again and then go down and get the LO her bottle. Once she is rolling around on the floor then I figure out how the coffee maker works.

I drink coffee, she babbles away on the floor for a half an hour. Once that's done we have some breakfast and  then while I shower she plays with her rubber ducks on the floor.

Once that's all done it's snack time! Goldfish for her, more coffee for me.

By then it's about 11 am and then she just plays on the floor and I usually do a chore or two around the house.

Up next, it's time for lunch andt then the daily update by [Andrew Cuomo](http://ny.gov) which brings us to about noonish. Sometimes there's a bit of time for [Sesame Street](https://amzn.to/34w2kFG) and sometimes it's straight to bed for the Afternoon Nap.

If I'm lucky she will stay down for an hour so **I can nap too** which brings us to 3pm or so. A bottle or a snack happens when she wakes up and then we play with her walker every day about 4pm for a bit. She has the standing and the holding figured out but there's definitely no walking yet.

5pm everybody eats (early,I know) and then we just survive the rest of the night until it's bedtime about 7pm.
Because we **don't leave the house** bath times have been a little screwy but if she's upset now is the time to get her into the tub to play with toys in the tub.

One last bottle for her before bed and then *poof* we survived another day. :)

The adults in the house have been watching [Ozark](https://www.netflix.com/title/80117552) to wind down from the exciting day. Then it's one last hour on the internet or other time wasting activities (like writing thi  blog post) and then it's bedtime for everybody!

But, if you have kiddos that **stil nap** count yourself lucky like us, but also take care of yourself first and **have a nap too**. It's a long day no matter who you are but if you can squeeze in a nap mid-day I highly recommend it.
