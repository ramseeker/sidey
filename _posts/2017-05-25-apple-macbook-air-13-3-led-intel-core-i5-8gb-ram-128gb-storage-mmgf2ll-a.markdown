There’s really not a lot of upgrades you can do for this MacBook Air.




## 2015 MacBook Air Hard Drive Upgrades




You can upgrade the MacBook Air’s Hard Drive to a larger storage capacity, but it’s not cheap with 256GB SSD Upgrades going for about $250.00 [check price](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?ff3=4&toolid=11800&pub=5575019070&campid=5337133045&mpre=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fsch%2Fi.html%3F_odkw%3D2015%2Bmacbook%2Bair%2Bdrive%26_osacat%3D0%26_from%3DR40%26_trksid%3Dp2045573.m570.l1313.TR3.TRC2.A0.H0.X2015%2Bmacbook%2Bair%2Bssd.TRS0%26_nkw%3D2015%2Bmacbook%2Bair%2Bssd%26_sacat%3D0) and 512GB SSD’s selling for about $350.00 [check price](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?ff3=4&toolid=11800&pub=5575019070&campid=5337133045&mpre=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fsch%2Fi.html%3F_odkw%3D2015%2Bmacbook%2Bair%2Bdrive%26_osacat%3D0%26_from%3DR40%26_trksid%3Dp2045573.m570.l1313.TR3.TRC2.A0.H0.X2015%2Bmacbook%2Bair%2Bssd.TRS0%26_nkw%3D2015%2Bmacbook%2Bair%2Bssd%26_sacat%3D0)




A few other upgrades to consider would be adding a [new battery](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?ff3=4&toolid=11800&pub=5575019070&campid=5337133045&mpre=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fsch%2Fi.html%3F_odkw%3D2015%2Bmacbook%2Bair%2Bssd%26_osacat%3D0%26_from%3DR40%26_trksid%3Dp2045573.m570.l1313.TR1.TRC0.A0.H0.X2015%2Bmacbook%2Bair%2Bbattery.TRS0%26_nkw%3D2015%2Bmacbook%2Bair%2Bbattery%26_sacat%3D0) (not sure you need it in a 2015 model) or adding a monitor for more screen real estate.
