I’m on the soup diet. Also, the antibiotics and pain killer diet. Also: I’m missing a tooth.

This was a planned event, this toothless-ness and long-term, this is all for the better so all’s well that ends well.




A few tooth extraction notes: All things considered, it wasn’t all that bad to have a tooth yanked out of your head. Not that it was like a Saturday afternoon with my lottery winnings in my back pocket at a speaker store, but with the help of modern medicine and more importantly, a patient wife -  she’s had to put up with my sorry toothless-nes. She still loves me even though I now feel I could act in the next episode of the Beverly HillBillies.




Enough crying in my soup - we had a great few days even with the dental trip.




**First up: Ice Cream! **

On Sunday Night, we went to [Lockport for Ice Cream](http://lakeeffecticecream.blogspot.com/)! [Lockport](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Lockport,+NY&hl=en&sll=42.746632,-75.770041&sspn=4.090031,9.437256&oq=lockport&t=h&hnear=Lockport,+Niagara,+New+York&z=13) is about half an hour away from us and even though BW has lived here for five years she hadn’t been there. This goes to prove one thing: We’re meant for each other ! We don’t stray away from home much if left to our druthers.




Soo.. I had vanilla (plain, boring and predictable) and BW had some whiskey and brown sugar concoction. Afterwards we wandered around Lockport a bit and looked at the..wait for it..Locks!

**New Shutters! **




The big news here is that the front of our house has a new look thanks to Tim the Handyman ( Hey, I blog  - she can’t have it all) and despite the fact that these have been sitting in our freshly painted garage for a week, they are now up and installed and look great.




Goodbye salmon colored shutters and hello to a more classic black:

**We Walked In The Woods **




Sunday Night, on the eve of my much dreaded tooth yank, we walked off my final steak dinner for a while and went exploring the island. Who knew there was so much fun in our own backyard?

Lastly, due to my soup diet I am on the lookout for softer foods for the next few days - what could be better than fresh baked biscuits by yours truly?




What a week so far. Thank goodness BW took good care of me and went to [the Wegmans](http://www.wegmans.com) and bought me lots and lots of soup. I’m a lucky guy, tooth or no tooth.
