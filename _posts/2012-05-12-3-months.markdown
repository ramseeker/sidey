[![](http://jim.am/images/2012/05/flowers.png)](http://jim.am/3-months/flowers/)Today, we’ve got 3 months of wedded bliss under our belts and I thought  I’d share what I’ve learned:




**10 Things I Learned About Being Married**






  1. 



I’m in charge of romance.






  1. 



I’m the morning person. She’s not._**_






  1. 



It’s not all about you anymore.






  1. 



You don’t need much. Flat screen TV’s and [more shoes](http://jim.am/does-your-wife-have-too-many-shoes/) or whatever else you think you need - you don’t. You just need each other.






  1. 



I’m slowly becoming a little obsessive over the lawn.






  1. 



The dog has gotten used to me and vice-versa.






  1. 



You’ll get used to the ring.






  1. 



I make better salads than I used to.






  1. 



Wedding cake still tastes pretty good - even after it’s frozen. (is there such a thing as bad cake?)




10.Getting  married is the best thing I have ever done.
