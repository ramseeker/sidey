**Buy RAM for iMac.** Do it. If you have an Apple iMac (or are considering buying an Apple iMac) you should fill that sucker with RAM.




**[Best Apple iMac](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8IO6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ramseeker-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002QQ8IO6)**




I’ll tell you why, too. I’m going to guess that you bought that Apple iMac for the looks, the simplicity even maybe because it was the best deal on an Apple iMac you could get and you couldn’t pass on such a great Apple iMac Deal. Whatever your iMac buying reasons, there’s one thing you want it to do: run without problems.




More RAM for iMac does this. It allows your Apple iMac to breathe, if you will. All the technical mumbo-jumbo aside when you buy more ram for you iMac (and install it yourself, it’s easy) you give a fresh blast of fresh air to your computer. Ever been in a small space, say like an elevator and it’s just a little too…close? The iMac feels the same way when it’s running the numbers for you and massaging all that data for you so you can surf facebook or even make money with your iMac (if you’re using your iMac to make money than the argument for adding more iMac RAM just increased ten fold) . Your iMac need some space. We’re talking working space here. RAM for you iMac is like buying a bigger house. All of sudden you’ve got a bigger place and your iMac can run free and do all that heavy computing for you – all because you bought iMac RAM.

Yes, you can buy ram for iMac from Apple – and you may think that this is the best solution – they made the computer, right? So of course all the geniuses at the Apple store can help you with ram upgrades – and they can. You can order ram for the iMac online too and you can get it from the Apple Store. The problem when you buy ram from apple directly is hoo boy is it pricey.




You do get the excellent apple support and at one time, there was actually apple ram and windows ram but not any more – as long as RAM for your iMac meets the apple specifications, you can buy iMac RAM a lot cheaper from more than one memory store.




As luck would have it, I have made a list of all the places you can buy ram for iMac. There’s lots more stores than the memory stores I list of course, but all the memory stores I list I can recommend. In fact, most memory stores have been selling ram for iMacs since the very first iMac with that funky teal color and round mouse and for that you get piece of mind knowing you can buy iMac ram for less but it’s still guaranteed to work in your iMac without trouble. And in the slight chance that there is a problem with your [RAM for iMac,](http://www.jim.am/memory/iMac_KITS_(DDR3_1333)/) these stores will work with you to sort out any ram problems you might have with your iMac RAM.
