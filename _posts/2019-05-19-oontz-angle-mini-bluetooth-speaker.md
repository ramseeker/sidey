After my last article about not using images, I might regret that for the most part as  some posts do go better with images. I don't know. I know that I like to write in plain text and that the Wordpress editor kills me to use it so I keep coming back to using a [SSG](http://staticgen.com) to great my posts.

It's doable, but I just don't have the patience to write posts and then insert a bunch of images as the images never seem to load for me or there's permission screwups, etc.

Anyway, no image.  But I bought this  [little bluetooth speaker](https://amzn.to/2WdgKci) and it works quite well for playing lullabies for the little one.
