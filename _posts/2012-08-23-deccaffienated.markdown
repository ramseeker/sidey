[![I love coffee](http://jim.am/images /2012/08/JIM_9394.jpg)](http://www.timhortons.com)




If you know me you know I have a wee bit of addiction problem. I’m not addicted to love (well, okay..maybe I am), or drugs or booze. I am flirting with an eBay addiction, but that’s a story for another day as it would take me tomes and tomes to write about all the crap I’ve bought on eBay (**_Oh, Hi Honey - I didn’t realize you read this_)..**




**Back  to the  story:** I like coffee. Maybe like is too tame a word. Saying that I like coffee is like saying that Bill Clinton didn’t inhale - both are lies. I love coffee and thank goodness there’s a Timmy’s down the road or the transition to the ‘ol **red white and blue** and **oh say can you see** would be even harder for me, but thankfully I’m only a mile down the road to salvation and there’s another church of caffeination opening up even sooner. Better yet, the mediums here a huge.




Now that we’ve got established my love for the black nectar, I have a confession to make:** I broke the Keurig Machine.**




This woudn’t be that big a deal if it weren’t for the fact that **this is the second Keurig machine** that can’t handle my 20-cups a day habit (too much?). That’s two $150 coffee machines I’ve burned out in just over a year.  Needless to say, there won’t be a third.  I’m thinking a french press might be able to handle the abuse but time will tell.




Now, before you all go call 911, It’s OK - **I have everything under control, and  I have backups**. I have an espresso machine and a coffee maker to get me through these hard times. It will be rough adjusting to life without on demand hot coffee by the cup, but as I am learning there are sacrifices when one gets married, and we all have to say goodbye to our carefree single days and make do with just three coffee makers in the house.  It will be hard, but I think I’ll be able  to manage.




Now, any recommendations for replacements would be great, or better yet - If you know of any place where I can buy a caffeine patch for my arm, that might work too. Also if anybody wants a Keurig coffee maker for parts or repair - I have one. Two, actually. ?
