She entered the world about five days ago, but I'm just figuring out what way is up after a few sleepless nights, so I am just around to getting this posted now. 







She entered the world 5lbs, 5oz and 18.5 inches long. She is still in the NICU because she couldn't wait to get here, and I can't wait to get her home to me. 







The good news is that Mom came home from the hospital today so now I just need to break my little lady out of the hospital.
