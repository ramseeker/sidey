I'm not exactly sure how, but we have settled on the  Amazon brand for a lot of the stuff we need for our little girl as itâ€™s usually a pretty good price and you can buy it in your underpants. 

Case in point are these baby wipes:

You would think that having 720 wipes would mean that you get to wipe a butt 720 times but  it ends up being more like about 300 because you end up always leaving the lid open because you have a screaming child full of poo and so that's your major concern and not whether you remembered to put the lid back on the stupid wipe package. 

Anyway. [Buy These.](https://amzn.to/2KiVwmD) The are awesome and cost 2 cents each.
