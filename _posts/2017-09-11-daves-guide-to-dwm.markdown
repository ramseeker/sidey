I have moved away from MacOS over the years and after a bit of a [stint with Chrome OS](https://jim.am/2017/02/07/going-all-in-with-google/) I’ve switched over to using linux and specifically [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) with the [dwm windows manager](https://dwm.suckless.org/) and [Dave’s guide to dwm ](http://ratfactor.com/dwm.html)is the best I have found for learning how this WM works and the keyboard shortcuts you need to memorize for better productivity with your PC.
