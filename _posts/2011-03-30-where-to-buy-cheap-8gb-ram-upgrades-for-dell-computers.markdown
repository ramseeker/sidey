I can happily answer this question on **[where to get a good price on dell computer memory](http://www.jim.am/where-to-buy-computer-memory-upgrades/)** , but seeing as you didn’t specify whether you were looking for an upgrade on either your  Dell desktop computer or your Dell notebook, I’m going to hazard a guess and answer this as you were looking for **[cheap 8GB for Dell notebooks ](http://amzn.to/2oA2gjC)**as these notebook computers tend  to be the best selling computers you can buy from Dell in 2011.




Which **Dell Notebook**?[![Cheap Dell Notebook RAM](http://www.jim.am/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-30-at-2.53.23-PM.png)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004K1EQO6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ramseeker-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B004K1EQO6)




**[Best Price on Dell Inspiron Computers](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004K1EQO6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ramseeker-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B004K1EQO6)**




Now it’s time for me to ask questions. You didn’t tell me what computer model from Dell you specifically wanted  to upgrade when it comes to [Dell memory upgrades](http://www.jim.am) so let’s assume you want to upgrade one of the most popular Dell notebooks on sale that will accept 8GB of RAM. This  would be the [Dell Inspiron Notebook](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26scn%3D565108%26redirect%3Dtrue%26ref_%3Dsr_nr_scat_565108_ln%26keywords%3Ddell%2520inspiron%2520notebook%26qid%3D1301511039%26h%3Db229a1013fc0d38cc632a26a668c5de4f28c061c%26rh%3Dn%253A565108%252Ck%253Adell%2520inspiron%2520notebook&tag=ramseeker-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957), and though it ships standard from Dell with just **4GB of memory installed in this Dell Notebook**, the RAM can be  upgraded to 8GB effectively  doubling the RAM on this particular Dell notebook.




**Where to Buy Cheap Dell Memory Upgrades **




****I have created a great list of all the memory stores you could buy memory upgrades for Dell computers from and these are all great places to **buy RAM for Dell computers** (and many other computer brands too – not just Dell) . One of the best things about buying RAM from one of the vendors I list here is that you can be sure that all the **RAM upgrades you buy for your Dell** – 8GB or otherwise – will be that the **total cost for Dell memory** will be much cheaper thanks to the fact that Dell charges more for RAM in most instances than if you were to do a bit of shopping online and buy memory upgrades from a trusted memory source. The other reason is that with most **memory stores specializing in Dell RAM** you can save more money on RAM for Dells as you have the option to buy both the cheaper generic RAM for Dell, or if you prefer you can buy brand name  Dell memory upgrades but be aware that this  will cost you more than thew Generic RAM.  A few name brand memory manufacturers for Dell memory include [Crucial](http://amzn.to/2oA2gjC), [Kingston](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26scn%3D172500%26redirect%3Dtrue%26ref_%3Dsr_nr_scat_172500_ln%26keywords%3Dkingston%2520memory%26qid%3D1301510761%26h%3D6518adcfc6bf51d5edefa8705761def90a1da114%26rh%3Dn%253A172500%252Ck%253Akingston%2520memory&tag=ramseeker-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957) and [Corsair](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dcorsair%2520memory%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&tag=ramseeker-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957).
