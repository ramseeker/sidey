Today’s Word is…




**house fire!**

I’m pretty sure this isn’t what is meant when the recipe calls to preheat the oven.




It seems that the[ pie BW baked me ](http://jim.am/2018/01/11/miss-american-pie/)spilled over a little bit and so the drippings were burning off.




For those who are wondering: I do know where the fire extinguisher is, and our pizza for lunch turned out just fine.

Thankfully it’s freakishly warm today so I could open the windows to let the smoke out for an hour or so.




We have the oven self-cleaning now as I write this so that this won’t happen again for a little while at least.
