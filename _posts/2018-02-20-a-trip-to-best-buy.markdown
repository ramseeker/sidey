I have gone to Best Buy many many times over the years and have always come home empty handed, because of the **wife approval factor**.




It took me six years of wedded bliss and an OK by BW but I was finally allowed to go and actually buy something! As the photo shows, I bought a [Google PixelBook](https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixelbook-i5-RAM-128GB/dp/B075JSK7TR) that I am writing this on now in [Google Docs](https://www.google.com/docs/about/)




And It’s great and all I need for my work. I have used - and still love - using Macs and other PC’s and I have tried to return them but then I realize that I do all my work in Google Chrome so it made sense to just get a Chromebook.




In a way, this laptop purchase is a celebration of sorts but I can’t share what just quite yet.




So as they say in the movies…. Stay tuned.
