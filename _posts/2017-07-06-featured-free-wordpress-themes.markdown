If you’re starting a blog, one of the easiest ways to get started is with a self-hosted wordpress blog and you of course, will need  theme.  It’s easy to get distracted with choosing different themes so the best way to start is to just pick a theme - any theme - and then  start writing.




The Twenty Seventeen theme is a good theme to get started with.
