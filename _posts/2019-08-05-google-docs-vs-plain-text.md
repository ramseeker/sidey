I know, I know...I have [written before](https://jim.am/from-google-docs-to-jekyll/) about writing in Google Docs, but I haven't in a while and for **some posts** it sure does make it easy to write - especially when you have images.

The downside is that I'm using a [Google Docs Add-ON](https://jim.am/gabriel-google-docs-add-on/) that may or may not keep working so I don't want to get to reliant on it for my workflow.

So, for now - as much fun as writing with Google Docs, nothing beats going all in with a text editor and **just start writing**
