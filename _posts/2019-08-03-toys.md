The toys have started to appear. For a long time it was all about the [bottles](https://amzn.to/2YHPHmu) and the [boppies](https://amzn.to/2KnSgVU) but now it seems she is getting old enough to play with some of the toys you see.

I want to be the guy that invented [wubanub](https://amzn.to/33966E7) where you take a cheap pacifier and staple a cheap stuffed animal to it and then market it for 18 bucks.

Needless to say we have but **one** of these and we watch it like a hawk so it doesn't get lost.
