This sucks. Earlier this year, I had bought [cheap desktop PC](https://amzn.to/2zsh5hB) on eBay for $40.00 and added a faster drive and it was working great as server in the basement.

And, like every night I turn it off as I don't need it to be on overnight so it only makes sense to save some energy and turn it off.

Today, I go to turn it on and nothing. No lights, no noise, no fans. Nothing.

It's dead. Which is a bit of pain in the ass but compared to [other catastrophes](https://jim.am/samsung-dryer-crap/) this week has seen. It was the cheap computer I used to play around with and try stuff so it's no big deal.

But now I'm out a desktop computer. Here's the thing: I don't think I am going to replace it. It was dated, big and noisy. Compared to the [fanless notebook](https://amzn.to/3eMgTd5) I using to write this, that thing was a beast.

But with my laptop it's **silent** and you don't realize how loud computer fans can be until you don't have any. I have moved my site over to my [Vultr Server](https://jim.am/cheap-vps-servers/) and I'm using my notebook as essentially a terminal and letting the server doing all the **computing**.

The server isn't free and it's not quite as fast as my old PC, but it's close enough and at $6 a month, it's pretty cheap considering I don't have to leave a computer plugged in and running all day when in reality I only need a 'server' for about an hour a day when I write.

It's sad that my cheap computer died, but I am OK and adjusting. I wonder if this was the last true desktop PC I ever buy?
