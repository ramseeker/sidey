I have come to realize that the child really has only 3 modes: 

* eat
* play
* sleep

The trick is to figure out **what** she needs of the three, and they keep on changing **all the time** but I have found that if she eats every 3 hours, and then plays for an hour and then sleeps for an hour (when I can find time to write this) then we're in pretty good shape when it becomes caring for her. 

It's interesting that even at this young age she's developed habits and a pattern to her growing and learning.
