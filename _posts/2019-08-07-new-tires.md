I bought new tires for the car today and **boy are they pricey** I found the cheapest tire I could find and yet they still cost me $100 each.

I only ended up buying 2 tires vs 4 as my car is pushing 13 years old with almost 200,000 miles on it so I did not want to spend a lot of money on 4 only to have the car die on me as soon as I had them installed.

I have to say, even though they were the cheapest, they still look pretty good to me but I am no tire expert so what the heck do I know.
