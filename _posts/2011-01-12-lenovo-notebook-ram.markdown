Today, I want to do a bit of research in helping you find the best deal when it comes to [Lenovo Notebooks](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26scn%3D565108%26redirect%3Dtrue%26ref_%3Dsr_nr_scat_565108_t%26keywords%3Dlenovo%26qid%3D1294849819%26h%3D4ccd75d2eca2f62e2ebfabd1893d2bb3da4a485e%26rh%3Dn%253A565108%252Ck%253Alenovo&tag=ramseeker-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957) and memory upgrades. I can rhyme of technical specs of Apple Memory without the blink of an eye but when it comes to windows PCs, I find the selection and configurations that the PC manufacturers offer to be almost overwhelming. Besides, I’m an Apple Fan from way back. But RAM is RAM and the same benefit you get from **upgrading your Apple computer **to the most memory possible also applies to PC notebooks too: If you [add more memory to your laptop ](http://www.jim.am/memoryx)it will run smoother and faster and with more applications avialable than before.
