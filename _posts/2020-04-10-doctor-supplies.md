I wish I didn't have to post this, but Bernie is right - the health care in this country is ridiculous. Even if **you have very good insurance** as I am lucky enough to have you still get dinged non stop for stuff that should be insured.

My latest example: I had a small procedure in January and was in and out in 2 hours from start to finish. A week of healing and I'm good again.

Then the bills and explanation of benefits come. The first bill was pretty straight forward: They wanted to ding me for a co-pay for the anesthesia but whatever.

But then, a week later I get a bill for the 'supplies' that the doctor used, like oxygen and an IV pole and other stuff which I have learned with all my research into this stuff is called **DME** for "Durable Medical Equipment".

It turns out accoring to my insurance plan that these DME's are not covered and are applied to my deductable as they were not provided by an "in-network provider".

The Doctor? He's in network, so we are good.
The Supplies he used to do his job? The same guy's supplies are not covered as they were from an **out of network supplier**. How can that be?

It's the same guy. His name is on both bills: one for his services (cutting me open) and the next bill was for the DME's (the knife) and yet this one is not covered.

And it's not like this "medical equipment" was a pair of [crutches](https://amzn.to/34u3D84) or even a [box of band-aids](https://amzn.to/2JWd3jn) they sent me home with  - it's oxygen to put me under and use of the machine!

Maybe I am wrong but it sounds like this guy wants to paid twice: once for the services and then again for his equipment being used.

No. Not going to happen. At very least, I'm fighting this because - why not? I have **nothing to lose**. If I lose an appeal I have to pay.

If I don't appeal this then **I pay regardless** so I might as well try to fight it.

This just smells fishy to me. This procedure was "medically neccessary" and so the whole enchilada should be covered and not just what the insurance company feels like covering.

It's times like these I miss [Canada](http://canada.ca) and universal health care.
