This site is all about - as you can guess by the name - using PowerPC computers.




In the age of the MacBook Air being considered old tech it’s refreshing to see that some still have use for computers much older than that.




I have always wondered if I could use a PowerBook G4 from 2005 or later in 2017 and actually get any work done or would it be too slow for me now that I am used to using faster machines?




Regardless, check out the link if you’re looking to spring new life into your older PowerPC computer as there are lots of good resources here.
