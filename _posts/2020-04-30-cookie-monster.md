The cookie monster landed at our house today. Her Grandmother heard that she liked Sesame Street and the cookie monster and next thing you know there's a [cookie monster toy](https://amzn.to/2xnQHVt) on the front porch.

Apparenty that's how this works. Next time, I'm going to tell her she likes a new Apple MacBook Air and see how that pans out. :)

Back to the cookie monster: It's blue and talks "cookie monster" "nom, nom, nom".
- That's the good part. The bad part is it does this **nonstop** which could be a bit of a pain in the ass if your kid likes this toy as mine does. Adults can only handle so much cookie monster.

And to make matters worse (or better, depending on your view) there are now home-made chocolate cookies in the house. If these don't get put away  **I'm the one thats going to turn into a (very large) **cookie monster**.
