I’m about a week or so away from  twenty years of ramseeker and listing ram prices, and I think I’m due for a change  - or ‘pivot’ as it’s been said.




RAM isn’t really that big of a seller any more and also it’s pretty cheap and for the most part the same price from most vendors. Even if the price does vary it’s by a few dollars at most.




I mentioned before I am [out of memory](https://jim.am/2016/05/out-of-memory/) as it’s time has come and gone. The iPhone is close to being the primary computer for a lot of people and you can’t upgrade the ram in these either.




When it comes to the Mac, it’s the same - save for a few [iMac model](https://jim.am/2015/10/owc-confirms-new-21-5-inch-late-2015-retina-imacs-can8217t-accept-user-installed-ram-upgrades/)s you can’t upgrade the ram in practically any Mac now. I suppose there’s a market for ram for older computers but the last MacBook Pro you could add RAM to is now almost six years old.




To summarize: the days of RAM upgrades are over except for those upgrading older computers and this is not a niche or market I want to pursue over the years as it’s only going to get worse over time.




The same goes with storage. Yes, there is still a demand for hard drives and SSD’s but I’ve never really tracked them as they are pretty much all the same - just pick a brand and size you like or need. I think that these too will go away over time with the Cloud being your number one place for storing your files - I know it is for me.




## So Now What?




I’ve tried a few things and failed spectacularly over the last few months from [O](https://jim.am/2017/06/on-curation/)[n Curation](https://jim.am/2017/06/on-curation/) to writing about upgrades for the few that can still take an upgrade like the [Lenovo x260](https://jim.am/2017/09/lenovo-thinkpad-x260-ram-and-ssd-upgrades/) but I don’t think that tracking ram prices is the way to go forward for the long term,




What I do want to do is to start publishing more, but what? RAM prices are out but everything else is up for grabs and I always come back to one thing - shopping. Heck, ramseeker started because I liked to shop but twenty years ago ram was expensive and so comparing prices made sense because saving just a little bit of money on RAM made a difference.




I guess going foward I will write about a bunch of topics but with the prices in mind, specifically** what stuff costs.**  Writing about stuff is easy for me and I like to shop, so this is a combination of that.




I’ve had a good run over the past 20 years but it’s time to move away from memory upgrades. My phone and notebook have all the ram they need and I bet you’re in  the same boat.




Thanks for visiting.
