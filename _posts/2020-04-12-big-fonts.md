It used to be when I was younger and monitors were smaller that I would have my monitor set to the **highest resolution** all the time because there was more room for your windows and files.

But now, the first thing I look for is how to increase the font size. I think there's a few reasons for this.

First, is that I'm no spring chicken any more. I've had bifocals for longer than I care to share. Also, the computers have got better.

Secondly, even my [chromebook](https://amzn.to/3b55Dq6) has multiple desktops and split screen and easy ways to tab through windows so even though I have a lot of screen real estate, I don't really need it as it's quite easy to switch windows or desktops with any OS now to get to the window you need.

And also screens are smaller. My "XL" phone measures under six inches and is probably my most used computer. Small screens and bigger font sizes are almost a must these days.

I guess what I am trying to say is that all this 4k monitor and high refresh rate doesn't mean a lot if you change the font size so the letters measure 2 inches tall.
