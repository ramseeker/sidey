I've been tripping over stuff in my home office for **some time now** and as much I like stuff, there's a time when it's all just **too much** and I think I have gotten there. Epsecially when it comes to using my computer for what I do.


It used to be that one would need a fast computer for editing photo and videos but **my phone has replaced my computer now** and the only computer I need for actually creating stuff is a very simple computer - and for me, that's my Chromebook.

I have used MacOS forever and have dabbled with Linux which I actually prefer over MacOS becuase it seems to get out of the way more and actually allow you to work.

I write this blog in markdown and then use [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) to publish this site via Google [firebase](http://firebase.google.com) because for my use case it's free. Well, close. It costs me 3 cents for monthly storage costs so not **completely free* but really close.

One other aspect about using just my Chromebook instead of other methods is that I just use **one computer** as opposed to juggling. It just got to be too much  with all the cables.

I have **one cable** from my Chromebook to connect to my dock which is hooked up to external monitors and drives, etc and this makes it easy to grab the Chromebook and go, and then when I need a fullsized monitor and keyboard I just plug in one cable for power and all accessories. It really is a nice system.

I do this. I need to have **all the things** and then once I do have them all I realized I only needed one or at most, two to get stuff done.

So there you have it. Sent from my [Chromebook](https://amzn.to/2UG3Wte).
