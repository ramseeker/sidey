I have to stop this. I get **great ideass** but absolutely zero follow-through. I was just going through my domain name list that I had already culled a fair bit but it seems it need more as there are a lot of domain names I have that are up for renewal that I am never going to use - despite my best intentions.

I had thought I would have used some of the domains I had bought by now, but despite my best intentions they go unused. Fron what was hundreds of dollars annully on domain renewals has now been bought down to under $200.

I am keeping this domain and 3 others and that's it. I will work one one project at a time until I can get it to be profitable and then, and only them will I consider a domain name for my next project.

It just costs too much to keep all these domain names over the years for projects that never materialize.
