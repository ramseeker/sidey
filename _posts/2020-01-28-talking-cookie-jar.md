I guess you could call this progress: she now puts the crap **back in the jar** as opposed to just pulling it out and waiting for me to put the stuff back.

I really don't know how to work this yet as we have had only this day, I think it must have sensors that detect when a little hand reaches in for a "cookie" and then talks. I dunno. 

All I do know is it entertained her for 20 minutes this morning so I'm good. :) 

If you need your own talking cookie jar you can [buy your own](https://amzn.to/2RVEflT). They are priced at about $20.00
