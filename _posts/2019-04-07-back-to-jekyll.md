I really want to like [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) but I can't seem to let the thought of having  a faster site than what is possible go.

So...I'm back to using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) as the technology that powers this site as the cost ends up being about the same as Wordpress hosting I was paying for but I no longer have to worry about plugins and updates and other stuff I don't need. I just want to write and post a few images and that's about it and I can do this with Jekyll.
