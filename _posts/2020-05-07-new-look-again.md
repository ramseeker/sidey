title: The New, New Look
layout: post

I really hadn't meant for this to happen but I was browsing [jamstack themes](https://jamstackthemes.dev/) for what might possibly be a new theme for this site and lo and behold, I found one.

I then tweaked it some and here we are. redesign number 1000, or at least it feels like it.

I have essentially combined this site into two parts: links and posts.

If it's blue - it's a link to an external site.
If it's black - it's a link to an internal page like this post

That's it!

This will allow me to link to stuff I find interesting and then write about stuff I want to write about - all on the same site. So far, I like this new look.
