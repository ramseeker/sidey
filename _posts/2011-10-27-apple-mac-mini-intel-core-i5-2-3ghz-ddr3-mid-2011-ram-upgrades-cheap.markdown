[![Best Price on Apple Mac Mini](http://www.jim.am/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-Shot-2011-09-02-at-7.28.18-AM.png)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YLCLM6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ramseeker-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399373&creativeASIN=B004YLCLM6)




The Apple Mac mini Intel Core i5 2.3 GHZ was a slightly less powerful version of the Mac Mini introduced in mid-2011. The Mac Mini was the first Mac desktop for the consumer market. Conceived as an entry level model to the Apple product line, like its sibling unit the Mac Mini 2.6 GHz i5, it  has no display, keyboard or mouse and no built-in optical drive. Apple promoted this as “Bring Your Own Display, Keyboard and Mouse…” to justify the lower cost.  By eliminating the optical drive in all Mac Minis since the first they were able to reduce their initial MSRP down one hundred dollars from its predecessor.




The Apple Mac mini Intel Core i5 2.3 included the server version as part of the Mac OS, as have all Mac minis since the first revision of the model in mid 2010.




The Apple Mac mini Intel Core i5 2.3 GHz features the aluminum unibody design that replaced the original chassis which featured a polycarbonate top and bottom panels on the aluminum case. The unit measures 7.7 inches (19.7 cm) square and 1.4 inches (3.6 cm) tall. It weighs 2.7 pounds (1.22 kg). The processor that shipped with the computer was a 2.3GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 with 3MB on-chip shared L3 cache
