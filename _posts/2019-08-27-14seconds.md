I have been futzing around with my "workflow" still  when it comes to creating this site and others. Specifically, I have been giving [hugo](http://gohugo.io) a go as it's technically **faster** than [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), but in my testing it's not **that** much faster.

Yes, Jekyll is still slow compared to hugo but I think that I can wait 14 seconds while my site builds. 

It's always fun to get the newer and shiny stuff but with Jekyll 14 seconds to build over 700 pages is pretty good.
