Not every post can be about how wonderful BW is and this one of them.




Wait, let me rephrase that: BW, you ARE wonderful but it’s just that this post won’t be to your liking. ( Whew, that was close)




Anyway, the past day or two I’ve been in nerd heaven at home here exploring new software and the like and I just have to share this:

It’s called [Pi-Hole](https://pi-hole.net/) and it’s software intended to be installed on a raspberry pi and then connected to your router. It then only allows your computer to call from known servers and not ad servers.




And wow! I forgot how fast the web could be before it got ruined with ads. I’m not so much against some webmaster with a few ads that makes him/her some money. It’s just that some have really gone to town with the advertising and tracking and I don’t need to know that 1 easy step to lose belly fat.




Here’s an example:




**With Ads**

**Without Ads**

Pages load much faster when you’re just loading the content and not all the ads.




I didn’t have a raspberry pi, but I did have an old laptop that could act as an ad blasting computer and now every device on our network doesn’t see an ad ever.




Total cost to zap internet ads : Nothing.




## Anker Bluetooth Headphones ![](http://jim.am/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/null-21.jpeg)




This was an impulse buy.




I bought them when I was at Lowes buying the blinds for our new [family room makeover](http://jim.am/2018/01/08/50-shades-of-gray/) and as they were half price marked down to $14.99 from $39.99 I figured what the heck, I can use them for listening to podcasts when I walk the dog.




Turns out, they’re much better than I expected. They connect right away, and the battery life seems to not be a problem for my use case and they stay in my ears. A neat feature is they have magnets on the back and when you connect them not only does it prevent tangles but it also turns the headphones off.




These are great.[ Buy Them](http://amzn.to/2qYwotP)




## Mood Lighting

I found some LED strip lights on ebay for ten bucks and thought I might as well try them and put them behind the TV and see how they look. Turns out, they work pretty well and even came with a remote control for brightness and colors. They plug directly into the TV for power too so when the TV gets turned off so do the lights.




Lastly…




It seems I got a [raise](https://www.ny.gov/new-york-states-minimum-wage/new-york-states-minimum-wage) at work.




Have a great weekend. ?
