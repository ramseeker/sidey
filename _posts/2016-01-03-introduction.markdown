_The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde_ tells the story of a lawyer investigating the connection of two persons, Dr. Henry Jekyll and Mr. Edward Hyde. Chief among the novel’s supporting cast is a man by the name of Mr. Poole, Dr. Jekyll’s loyal butler.




* * *




Poole is the butler for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), the static site generator. It’s designed and developed by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo) to provide a clear and concise foundational setup for any Jekyll site. It does so by furnishing a full vanilla Jekyll install with example layouts, pages, posts, and styles.




There are currently three themes built on Poole:






  * [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com)


  * [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com)


  * [Enfield](http://enfield.getpoole.com)




Learn more and contribute on [GitHub](https://github.com/poole/poole).




### What’s included




Poole is a streamlined Jekyll site designed and built as a foundation for building more meaningful themes. Poole, and every theme built on it like this one, includes the following:






  * Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, [404](/404.html), [RSS feed](/atom.xml), posts, and [example page](/about))


  * Mobile friendly design and development


  * Easily scalable text and component sizing with `rem` units in the CSS


  * Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements


  * Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post


  * Syntax highlighting, courtesy Jekyll’s built-in support for Rouge




Additional features are available in individual themes.




### Browser support




Poole and its themes are by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.




### Download




These themes are developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/poole/poole) for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.




Thanks!
