That’s what BW asked me the other day.




So ya, it’s been a while and I have stories to tell.




Last time when I left you we had just arrived at our vacay destination and then I left all my readers hanging and this led BW to ask the question above.




But, I have an excuse ( I always do).




So **yes ** it’s true that we have back from our vacation for some time now but I have been busy so there’s that. You see,every Wednesday since I have been back has been “wake up and paint something wednesday” and I have to tell you I have done a **lot of painting. **Or at least it seems that way.

I painted the deck:




And now that we have some lawn furniture on it and BW has been busy with the flowers, our little abode has been shaping up the last few weeks:

And then once I got that all painted the next was the garage floor:

After




So there’s that. I also have some other news and goings on to share but first…




## Our Vacation




We had just arrived in [Mobile Alabama](http://www.cityofmobile.org/) when I last wrote and once we landed late Saturday night we didn’t do much but plop ourselves into bed after being in the car so long but it’s a small world because the first thing I saw was that the previous guests at our AirBnB rental left a souvenir:




![IMG_20170603_203735438.jpg](https://jim.am/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_20170603_203735438.jpg.jpeg)




It’s a small world sometimes,




The following day, Sunday was pretty lazy day as we had no plans really. BW wanted to go to the beach on Sunday but I suggested we hold off so we avoid the crowds so that’s what we did.




BW did really well in picking the spot for our little getaway.




![IMG_20170604_120018796.jpg](https://jim.am/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_20170604_120018796.jpg.jpeg)




This spot had all the things you would need including a kitchen and all the goodies you would need like pots and pans etc. In fact, BW had our [blue apron ](https://www.blueapron.com/) box of the week sent to Mobile so we had some home-cooked meals and didn’t eat out all the time. She’s smart like that.




But we still ate our way across Mobile, to be sure.




One of the strangest things I learned that was I like to eat crawfish (who knew?)

We actually had to ask some nice young fellows on how the heck do you eat these things? They were nice enough to show us how and so we shared the feast you see above. I liked it so much that I convinced BW to take me back later in the week.




The restaurant was called [Mud Bugs](http://www.mudbugsattheloop.com/) and I think it was a great time considering what they served. They also had a rule that if you showed up at the counter to order with your phone they wouldn’t serve you and call somebody else.




After stuffing our faces we went Downtown to check out locals and it seems they have a li[ttle fort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Conde) in downtown mobile so we went and did and saw fort-y things.

They had a downtown museum on display as well of the history of Mobile as well so we checked out how the locals used to live:

And dressed:

By the time we saw all the sights it was getting late (or dinner time ) and so we went ‘home’ made dinner, watched a Netflix and because we are older we were in bed very early.




We did notice that the week we were there you could count on a thunderstorm every day at 4 for about 20 mins and then it was back to sunshine.

That’s all for now. I don’t want to write too big an an article and have my photos not upload so I will stop here for now but at least it’s a start.




Up Next: Beach Day!
