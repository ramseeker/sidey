In 2011, it does not cost a lot of money for [apple memory upgrades](http://amzn.to/2oA2gjC), and in fact now is the perfect time to buy mac memory as RAM has never been cheaper than right now for Apple Computers.

Let’s take a look at today’s RAM prices: As I write this you can [buy memory for MacBook Pros](http://amzn.to/2oA2gjC) for as little as $49 for 4GB of MacBook Pro memory, one of the best selling Apple notebooks available today. To maximize current memory on any modern MacBook Pro will need to replace the 4GB that ships as standard equipment when the MacBook Pro comes from Apple and replace it with 4GB memory modules x 2 for a total of 8GB of MacBook Pro RAM. To offset the cost of your MacBook Pro RAM there are many memory stores that will [buy back](http://www.jim.am/oempcworld) your [old ram](http://www.jim.am/ramjet) and and credit you against the newer and larger memory upgrades – regardless of which Apple computer you need RAM for and making the memory for your Apple Computer even that much cheaper. It’s possible you could [upgrade the RAM on your Mac](http://www.jim.am) for under $50 for most current shipping Apple computers – and even less if you’re looking to upgrade older Macs with cheaper and smaller ram modules.




When it comes to upgrading the memory on older Macintosh computers, you do need to be aware of the price and performance ratio, as some older Macs might not be worth it to add more memory to. Your computing dollar might be better spent on buying a new Mac, rather than upgrading the memory on an old computer where your performance dollar might be better spent.




Below are the best prices on Apple RAM for all current Apple computers such as Apple iMac, MacBook, MacBook Pro and Mac Pro
