When buying [memory upgrades for your notebook](http://www.jim.am) it’s often because you **[bought a brand new laptop for 2013](http://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers-Electronics-Laptop-Computers/zgbs/electronics/565108/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&linkCode=ur2&tag=ramseeker-20)** at least, that’s usually when I personally buy RAM because I want the fastest computer when the computer is brand new and not wait until the computer gets old and slower when compared to newer computer models, regardless of brand.




## Best Laptop Computer Brands for 2013




In 2013 as smartphones and and tablets increase market share, you might think that the notebook computer is dead, but this is not the case because even though tablets and phones increase in popularity nothing can beat typing on a real and physical keyboard and a notebook computer is  the only portable computing device that offers such. With that in mind, here’s a look at some of the best manufacturers of notebook computers for this year, in 2013.




## Google




New to the list of best selling notebooks this year when compared to last year is Google, with their line of notebook computers called chromebooks. [**Google offers some of the best selling notebooks**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009LL9VDG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B009LL9VDG&linkCode=as2&tag=ramseeker-20) this year thanks to the fact that these are the cheapest notebook computers you can buy. Take the Samsung ChromeBook for an example. At $249.00, you get an 11 inch notebook for 2013 that runs on the Google Chrome OS and offers excellent portable computing value for the price.




Some may argue that the Chromebook isn’t a real notebook computer when compared to Dell or HP or other notebook brands but that’s because you can’t run traditional applications on it like you can on a Windows based notebook computer. But with the flexibility and price the chrome OS offers thanks to Google Drive applications and the popularity of blogging sites or software that don’t require any applications but offer all work to be done online or in the cloud the chromebook is  an excellent notebook for the price and is small and light enough to be carried with you everywhere yet still offers USB ports, a full sized keyboard and a bright 11 inch LED display, it’s no wonder that the chromebooks for 2013 are the best selling notebook computer brands in 2013 so far this year.

## Apple




 




On the other end of the spectrum when comparing Apple notebooks to Google notebooks, you get one of the best selling computer brands this year, but at a price. The cheapest price for a notebook from Apple will cost you close to $1000, if not more, depending on what model you buy. The MacBook Air is what one might consider a direct competitor to the Google Chromebook when it comes to screen size (the 11 inch MacBook Air) but the OS is much more advanced on the Macintosh OS than if you were to buy a Chromebook. Google wants you to primarily to work in the cloud, while the MacBook is more of  a traditional PC. The advantages of the Apple notebooks vs Chromebooks is the OS and the available software. Faster processors and more RAM are also a distinct advantage of an Apple MacBook Air or MacBook Pro and if you’ve got other Apple products such as iPhones or iPods, they all work together without fuss or problems. Apple offers a high end solution for portable computing and charges a premium for the tight integration of hardware and software in Apple notebooks.

## Dell




 




 




Dell has long been a price leader when it comes to buying a cheap notebook online and in 2013, this hasn’t changed and their 2013 Dell Inspiron notebooks always tend to be one of the best selling notebooks of the year. The 15 inch Dell Inspiron is one example of a best selling notebook computer from Dell. Compared to the price of an Apple MacBook Pro, the Dell Inspiron is an absolute bargain at under $400.00 on sale for a full featured 15 inch notebook with a fast Intel Core i3 processor, 6gb of RAM and a 500GB hard drive all standard. The Inspiron also features one of the bigger displays when compared to the Apple or Google offerings with a 15.4 inch display. Windows 7 Home Premium is included for the price and you can upgrade to Windows 8 very inexpensively too if you feel the need.  There was a time when an under $500 notebook from Dell would be considered an absolute bargain but with notebook prices dropping over time thanks to cheaper components inside a Dell notebook you don’t need to look too hard to get a great deal on a Dell notebook in 2013.

## Toshiba




 




Despite the fact that Toshiba has the very worst naming conventions on their notebook PC’s with long model numbers instead of memorable names like the other manufacturers of notebooks above, you should consider buying a Toshiba notebook in 2013 due to the fact that the folks at Toshiba make a very good high quality product. You can buy cheaper notebooks to be sure (Acer comes to mind) but when in the market for  a higher quality notebook at a great price don’t hesitate to consider Toshiba notebook. Take the** Toshiba Satellite C855D-S5320 **for example.**  With a street price of under $400 **this is a great deal on a notebook for 2013. There’s not too many under $400 notebook computers you can buy today that offers the quality you can expect from Toshiba. This particular model of Toshiba notebook features a E-Series Dual-Core E2-1800 1.7 GHz processor with a 15.6 inch display, Windows 8 and 4GB of RAM with a 500GB hard drive.

## Lenovo




 




Lenovo is a relatively new notebook computer brand but if you look closely at the Lenovo brand you will see that this brand is really a subsidy of IBM, a name in computing that dates back decades, so you can rest assured you are buying a quality product when you are considering the Lenovo brand. Offering a top ten notebook for 2013 is not easy in the notebook shopping landscape with so many deals being available for a notebook computer this year. Lenovo offers a sub $500 notebook computer in the form of the Lenovo G580 notebook that offers a 15.6 inch display and comes with a fast Intel Core i3 processor, 4GB of RAM with a 500GB hard drive and Windows 8 pre-installed.

These are but a few of the best selling notebooks you can buy for 2013 and this list will change over the course of the year and I will do my best to keep this list updated but when shopping for a new notebook this year from some of the best brands, some models have a very short lifespan and replacements will soon be available so that’s why I recommend you keep an eye on the best selling notebooks of 2013 available
