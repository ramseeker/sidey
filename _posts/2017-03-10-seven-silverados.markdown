I spent the evening at work in 7 different chevrolet pickup trucks that really only differed in color and if a few cases the options as the[ Z71 option](http://www.chevrolet.com/silverado-1500-pickup-truck.html) has a few more toys and I think a bigger motor but I could be wrong.




I’m not quite sure why I’m to photograph the same truck over and over again even if the only thing different is the color, but hey it keeps me employed for the time being and BW likes that so there you go.




Weather was 32 degrees and cloudy.
