This Lenovo thinkpad tends to sell for about $100 as configured.




You will need to add more RAM and upgrade the hard drive to get it to top notch condition and performance. There’s some wear on the keyboard too so you might want to consider upgrading. A new battery might be a good idea too.




First, the hard drive. 250GB SSD drives[ are under $100. ](http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2380057.m570.l1313.TR7.TRC3.A0.H0.X250gb+ssd.TRS1&_nkw=250gb+ssd&_sacat=0)




Doubling the ram to 8GB would [cost about $50.00. ](http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2374313.m570.l1313.TR0.TRC0.H0.X8gb+ddr3+sodimm+kits.TRS0&_nkw=8gb+ddr3+sodimm+kits&_sacat=0)




If you go with a replacement keyboard you would add [another $35.00  ](http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_odkw=8gb+ddr3+sodimm+kits&_osacat=0&_from=R40&_trksid=p2045573.m570.l1313.TR0.TRC0.H0.Xthinkpad+t430s+keyboard.TRS0&_nkw=thinkpad+t430s+keyboard&_sacat=0)




A new battery would cost[ about $50.00](http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_odkw=thinkpad+t430s+keyboard&_osacat=0&_from=R40&_trksid=p2045573.m570.l1313.TR1.TRC0.A0.H0.Xthinkpad+t430s+battery.TRS0&_nkw=thinkpad+t430s+battery&_sacat=0)




Lastly, you will need a charger for[ about $10.00](http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_odkw=thinkpad+t430s+battery&_osacat=0&_from=R40&_trksid=p2045573.m570.l1313.TR0.TRC0.H0.Xthinkpad+t430s+charger.TRS0&_nkw=thinkpad+t430s+charger&_sacat=0)




Total it all up and a fast, thin and light thinkpad from 2012 would cost about $350.00 if you sum up all the upgrades you would need for this computer.
