This is a rant.

As great as the United States is, the health care system here is a disaster. Of course, [I'm not the only one](https://berniesanders.com/) that thinks so.

We've had some health issues in the family so of course, a few months later the bills come. I'm so sick of having to call the insurance company or provider and doing their job for them. More than once I have had to call both and explain that no, our insurance should cover that and you just have to send the right code or to the right department and you will get paid.

But that's not how health care works in this country. Here you get billed by the provider in a heartbeat and the onus is on you to either pay or find out what's going on and spend your life on the phone trying to figure it all out so that you don't have to.

I wish that someday my daughter will enjoy universal health care or some other system that works much better so she won't have to deal with this disaster.
