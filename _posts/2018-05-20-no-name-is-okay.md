When we[ brought the little one home ](https://jim.am/shes-here/) from the hospital we just used the same formula that they had been giving her in the NICU as I figured that they knew what they were doing when it came to selecting the right formula for our newborn better than I ever could. 

For a few months, all was fine but then the little squirt ended up eating **more and more** and I have to tell you that this [shit's expensive!](https://amzn.to/2LSkr34)  so we started to look around at alternatives before she eats us out of house and home..

## Hello, No Name Brand

"Comparable To" might just be my two favorite words of 2019 as I found the target brand and it's a **much bigger** box for about twenty bucks instead of close to 30 dollars I was paying for much less of pretty much the same thing. 

My daughter doesn't seem to mind the newer and cheaper Target stuff and I get to feed her for less. all of these are good things. :) 



It used to be a time when store brands sucked but I think over time for the most part they are very comparable to the more expensive branded products.
