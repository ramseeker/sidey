I just made it home, and barely got my coat off before I heard BW’s car pull up in the garage.




Guess what the first thing she says to me? (hint: see headline)




It seems my love for the[ pi-hole ](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjQvqmrrtvYAhUySt8KHSwpCbsQFggoMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fpi-hole.net%2F&usg=AOvVaw1ne_2xAHOJ7qD5qziD7tdQ)app I installed on our home wifi is **not** mutual because **OMG I BLOCKED HER FACEBOOK! She can’t get important notifications about cat photos and fake news. **




I asked her if  any other, you know - **important stuff ** got blocked? Nope all work stuff was fine. she emailed, and wrote just fine. She tried to blame me about her work email on her phone but I just quit the app




**BUT OMG FACEBOOK IS DOWN. I CAN’T LIVE LIKE THIS!  **




At least the dog was happy to see me when I got home. ?




PS: One click and I fixed the facebook problem. send moar cat pictures plz.
