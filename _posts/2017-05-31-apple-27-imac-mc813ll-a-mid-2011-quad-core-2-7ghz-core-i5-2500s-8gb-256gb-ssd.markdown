This computer costs about $600.00[ (check prices)](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?ff3=4&toolid=11800&pub=5575019070&campid=5337133045&mpre=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fsch%2Fi.html%3F_odkw%3DQuad%2BCore%2B2.7GHz%2BCORE%2Bi5%2B2500S%2B8GB%2B256GB%2BSSD%26_osacat%3D0%26_from%3DR40%26_trksid%3Dp2045573.m570.l1313.TR3.TRC1.A0.H0.X27%2Binch%2B2011%2Bimac.TRS0%26_nkw%3D27%2Binch%2B2011%2Bimac%26_sacat%3D0)




Maximum RAM: [about $100 for 16GB](http://amzn.to/2rqpNa0)




Hard Drive Upgrade: Not needed really unless you need more space. I would be fine with this size.




It’s quite possible you could buy this iMac for about $600 and then just use it. If you needed  more ram you could add 16GB for $100 so about $600 or so would get you a very nice iMac with a fast i5 processor and enough ram and a fast SSD already installed
