Wow, what a busy weekend. We travelled over 800 miles round trip and saw friends, family and more in the two days we visited. One of the best parts was just hanging out, eating well and  - well, I made a list:




## I Hung Out With The Ladies




Some, loved to get their photos taken:

## **Made Popcorn **




You have to watch the turning - it’s all in the wrist. You just need to turn a little bit..
