![Kingston Apple 1066MHz DDR3 SODIMM iMac and MacBook Memory](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41COaonQksL._AA300_PIbundle-1,TopRight,0,0AA300_SH20_.jpg)Apple MacBook Pro 2.66GHz Intel Core i7 17-inch was first introduced in spring of 2010–and continued to more than adequately fill the need for longer battery life charge by featuring the introduction of groundbreaking 10 hour battery.




**_Kingston RAM for Apple MacBook Pro 2.66Ghz under $40.00 for 8GB memory upgrade kits_**. **[ Buy NOW](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ramseeker-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW)**




Apple touted the MacBook Pro 2.66 GHz Intel Core i7 17 inch as the next significant upgrade in processor speed, stating that “17-inch MacBook Pro models are up to 50 percent faster than the previous systems”. The i7 processors used Intel’s state-of-the-art 32 nanometer process, integrating the memory controller and Level 3 cache for faster access to system memory. Hyper-Threading technology improved data throughput by creating virtual processing cores, while Turbo Boost optimized performance between the two processor cores, accelerating the system from 2.66 GHz to 3.06 GHz for intensive dual core tasks, and up to 3.33 GHz for single core tasks.




Apple also kept cranking out the graphic innovations in true Apple style with the introduction of the then new automatic graphics switching technology that toggled between powerful NVIDIA GeForce GT 330M and energy efficient Intel HD Graphics processors resulting in crisp graphics capable of supporting the most demanding 3D games, creative software and technical applications. The new graphics technology automatically determined which processor a particular application required and switched instantly to deliver high level performance. By integrating hardware and software closely, Apple was able to deliver the lauded 10 hours on a single charge of the built in battery.
