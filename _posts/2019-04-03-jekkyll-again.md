I'm back to using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), once again. 

I have done this so many times I can't count but I find that using wordpress is just so overly complicated with jetpack and other plugins are just overkill for a blog where I just want to write  and add a few links and photos. I don't need dynamic data or any high powered servers so this is better for me.
