Not for the food though. Even though we do seem to have burned through the dough lately when it comes to [grocery shopping](http://jim.am/the-cost-of-groceries/) that’s not the reason I am thinking about shopping for a very tall fridge.




We need a bigger fridge because my honey-do list keeps on growing and growing and  our current fridge is not tall enough to accomodate my ever growing task list. Maybe because I moved in during the dead of winter and the weather kept us inside or probably more like it, that despite my complaints (which seem to fall on deaf ears anyway) now is the time to do all this outdoorsy stuff, but I sure seem to be busy lately in the home improvement dept:




Let’s recap:






  * 


[I got rid of the dog kennel](http://jim.am/what-if-we-gave-it-away/)





  * 


[I made a garden](http://jim.am/how-to-save-on-you-grocery-bill-the-summer-2012-vegetable-garden-project/)





  * 


[I cut grass](http://jim.am/how-to-save-600-a-year-on-lawn-care/)





  * 


[I  clean closets](http://jim.am/just-call-me-chuck/)







and  more stuff, I am sure  Wash the dog, take out the garbage, etc…

But the latest  project I have been elected for is to **re-stain the back deck.** B goes away for a week next week at a conference and when the wife’s away, the tidy husband will.. **stain the deck?!**  It doesn’t even rhyme. But that’s what’s on the agenda for the next  few days - weather permitting.




**All is not lost.**




The good news  is that while the dog and I  are painting and partying  while the wife is away next week we have already started on the prep work today because I now nave this:




**Power, Baby. **




[![best washer for decks](http://jim.am/images/2012/06/washer.png)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003B6KQZE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ramseeker-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B003B6KQZE)




To prepare the deck for staining, one needs a power washer. We could have rented a power washer but then you have to return it, and it’s a pain and a power washer is one of those things you can always find another use for  - I mean this is not the last job I do.. and this Blue Clean power washer is a [pretty good one for the lousy $100 we paid for it on sale.  ](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003B6KQZE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ramseeker-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B003B6KQZE)




It  did the job quite nicely I think.




I washed the deck:

and the stairs:

As you can see,  the deck is  due for a re-paint.




Then I kept on going, because hellooo.. **I now have the power to clean!! **




So I kept going. I cleaned the grill:

And some mats and carpets:

and pretty much anything else I could find to power wash** because power washing is so much fun! **




The downside of all this is now that I have this amazing tool I now get to:






  * 


Wash and paint fence.





  * 


Wash and paint garage floor





  * 


Wash and paint lawn furniture







And that folks is why we need a bigger fridge. And I need a rest.




**PS: **this should probably be a post of it’s own but our veggie garden is coming along quite nicely:
