Expect to pay from [$1099.00 to $2299.00](http://amzn.to/2h5WDG1) for a brand new Apple iMac computer in 2016 (and going into 2017 as it’s unlikely there will be a refresh before that)




If you want to save some money on Apple iMacs you can also choose to buy a refurbished Apple iMac too. At time of writing range in price from [just over $900 to just over two thousand dollars](http://www.apple.com/shop/browse/home/specialdeals/mac/imac)




## Apple iMac Choices




The Apple iMac comes in 2 different screen sizes and 5 different configurations:






  * 


21.5 inch iMac with 1.6GHz Processor, 8GB of memory and 1TB Storage





  * 


21.5 inch iMac with 2.8GHz Processor, 8GB of memory and 1TB Storage





  * 


21.5 inch iMac with 3.1GHz Processor, 8GB of memory and 1TB Storage and retina 4K display





  * 


27 inch iMac with 3.2GHz Processor, 8GB of memory and 1TB Storage and retina 5K display





  * 


27 inch iMac with 3.3GHz Processor, 8GB of memory and 2TB Storage and retina 5K display







Actually there are many more iMac configurations than this because you can always add more ram or buy a SSD drive at time of purchase (both recommended)  

but if you are looking for the stock iMac then you’re looking at these five.




## iMac Disadvantages




There can be some disadvantages to using an iMac vs something like a Mac Mini and that’s the fact that these Apple desktops combine processor and display all in one unit. The iMac is a popular seller and closing in on it’s 20th anniversary but that’s something to consider.




Probably the biggest disadvantage is the fact that you have to spend close to $1000 and you’re still stuck with a spinning hard drive in 2016. I know, as desktops these are meant to be used either in the Office or Home and may hold many documents and photos and even the 1TB storage is too small, but if it were me I would not buy any computer that doesn’t have a SSD Drive standard.




There is a Fusion Drive as standard but it’s either extra money for this option or you have spend more and buy the 27 inch model.




## iMac Pros




The Pros of the iMacs are the fact that it’s an Apple and offers features that only an Apple computer can offer. If you want what is arguably the best screen on an all in one computer today, you should consider an iMac.




## Is an iMac worth it?




Only you can decide, but I can tell you that I don’t need one. I have ditched paying the Apple tax and am fully invested in Chromebooks where a little over $100 will give you a pretty competent machine for everyday computing tasks.




But, if you’re a power user and want a very fast computer from Apple with a very nice display and lots of choice when it comes to both storage and hard drive options then the iMac might be a very good choice.
