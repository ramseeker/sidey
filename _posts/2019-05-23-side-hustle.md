It's important to have a hobby site. When I started [ramseeker](http://ramseeker.com) way back when it started as a side hustle or hobby site and I hope to do this again.

I have started another site that I hope to sucessful but as it's still early days I have no way of knowing yet. In fact, I have a **long** way to go before it's all set up in any fashion. I have the design setup and the hosting figured out.

As always, I am going with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and Google's [firebase](http://firebase.google.com) for my publishing and hosting need because fast and free are hard to beat.

With that in mind the only thing will cost me is time. I have tried some other hustles and always gave up/got bored if I didn't have instant success so I want to try and be more patient this time. I'm going to give this site some time and I don't exect to have any success until the first year.

In the meantime, it's a lot fun and everybody should have a hobby or side hustle they can work on.
