This is the weather we’ve all been waiting for. The long summer nights as spring disappears and the official start of summer begins. And with the wife away and I have wheels too, **I have an opportunity here to get wild and crazy**, play the stereo loud in the car ([jazz](http://jazz.fm)) and head straight for:

You’ll note that how in the USA, they have the need to explain what Tm Horton’s is. [Not so in Canada ](http://www.timhortons.com/ca/en/index.html). But the Canucks do promote the ‘Always  Fresh’ I have noticed..




Anyhoo..  It could of been worse and my beverage of choice for this evening could have been this:

(and this probably costs less than my beverage of choice here too. The portion sizes seem to be the same for both and that’s **supersized!)**




This little adventure actually started earlier in the day actually when on the way back from a Doctor’s appointment I stopped at the drive through  (sorry, drive thru - old habits) pharmacy.** I didn’t have to get out of my car at all** to pick up my prescriptions!!  (_you know you’re middle aged when it’s not just one prescription any more - but many_) . And I realized that except for a stop at the grocery store **I made three other stops and never got out of the car**:






  1. 



Timmies






  1. 



Post Office  - you just drive up. Drive through window for stamps. And they have Saturday mail. I have a little thing for the USPS here but that’s another post all on it’s own






  1. 



Drug Store for above mentioned drugs.




After my steak dinner, I thought - what would happen if I got out of the car? What would I see? Only one way to find out…and off I go..




And right across the street from the ‘Cafe and Bake Shop’ I see this:

I thought to myself - this is perfect! They can explain about the Tim’s thing and the popularity of drive throughs and why there’s mail on Saturday but on closer inspection I saw that the place looked a bit deserted:




[![](http://jim.am/images/2012/06/closed.png)](http://jim.am/out-from-behind-the-wheel/closed/)




despite their welcoming signs:




[![](http://jim.am/images/2012/06/welcomeniagara.png)](http://jim.am/out-from-behind-the-wheel/welcomeniagara/)




I don’t think they’re open, regardless of what the sign says.

So while I drank my coffee on the bright red picnic table:

I reflected,




[![](http://jim.am/images/2012/06/nuts.png)](http://jim.am/out-from-behind-the-wheel/nuts/)




and asked myself - Now what do I do?** I guess I may as well go explore**. It’s not like there’s demand for space at the infocenter. I have the entire place by myself and it’s kind of nice to be out  in the warm summer air. Might as well have a look around:




I  saw lots of people who like me earlier, were stuck in their cars: Some had places to go:

and some travelled by bridge:

and some were just out cruising: ![](http://jim.am/images/2012/06/cruiser.png)




And some had parked their cars at the info center: I saw a blue Ford




[![](http://jim.am/images/2012/06/tractor.png)](http://jim.am/out-from-behind-the-wheel/tractor/)




And a red Ford.

But eventually, my coffee ran cold. I may as well take a bit of a walk and see what I can see, as this really was the purpose of this trip - to get out of the car and smell the:




[![](http://jim.am/images/2012/06/wildflowers.png)](http://jim.am/out-from-behind-the-wheel/wildflowers/)




wildflowers.




And I found that when you do this, the grass really is greener:

And you see all sorts of things you can’t see from behind the wheel of  a car:




[![](http://jim.am/images/2012/06/bird.png)](http://jim.am/out-from-behind-the-wheel/bird/)




You hear birds chirping




[![](http://jim.am/images/2012/06/bullrushes.png)](http://jim.am/out-from-behind-the-wheel/bullrushes/)




and bullrushes swaying in the breeze.




[![](http://jim.am/images/2012/06/plane.png)](http://jim.am/out-from-behind-the-wheel/plane/)




and see planes fly high above.




All of this I happend  by **getting out of the car** and using those things at  the end of your legs: **your feet**.




You also find you may need them to run, because: oops!




[![](http://jim.am/images/2012/06/private.png)](http://jim.am/out-from-behind-the-wheel/private/)




So with that in mind I ran back to the car,




[![](http://jim.am/images/2012/06/JIM_4437.png)](http://jim.am/out-from-behind-the-wheel/jim_4437/)




And drove back home to Pleasantville.




The End.
