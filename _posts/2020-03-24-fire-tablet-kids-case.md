This is one of the late addtitions to the **pile of stuff** that comes into the house when you have kids. I found this on [Mercari](http:/mercari.com) for a lot less than you can buy it on [Amazon](https://amzn.to/2QHiNBx)  as  I find that the cases  for [Amazon’s fire tablets ](https://amzn.to/2UeRuAE)  are kind of pricey. 

Consider this - the [tablet I bought this case for](https://amzn.to/2WH3RXC) sells for $49.00 and yet Amazon wants just under $30 for this case.  I know kids are rough on tablets but spending that much on a case that doesn’t cost much less than a tablet. 

 Anyway. Now I can hand it to her and there’s a good chance the tablet will survive the day.
