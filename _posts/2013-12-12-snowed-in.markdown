Here’s the scene: BW and I are eating dinner and the news announcer comes on the radio: “Snowfall tonight at 3 inches per hour”.




“Whoa!!” we say and hurriedly call family members who were planning on a six hour drive tomorrow morning to come visit that at this point in the game that might not be the wisest choice - even if you do want to see Niagara falls. So here we sit. Indoors, with 200+ Fraiser reruns to go on Netflix and it’s still up in the air whether I have to scrub the tub for company this weekend.




Also, has anybody seen the shovel?
