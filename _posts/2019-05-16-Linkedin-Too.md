I never, ever got any value whatsoever out of [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/) so it's absolutely no problem for me to get rid of this service as I never used it.

 In fact, I **forgot ** I had signed up for thisaccout over  a decade ago as the email it had on file was older than dirt and one I don't use so I didnâ€™t get any emails about this account at all. 

Needless to say if I hadn't used it in a decade that it was time to go.
