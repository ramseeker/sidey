I have tried a lot of different editors when it comes to writing for the web, but [HackMD](https://hackmd.io) 
might be a new favorite. 

For one thing it allows me to write a quick post and then upload it to github where I can pull it with [working copy](https://workingcopyapp.com/) and then post via a terminal app on my iPad. It's a bit of a kludge but it works. 

I can even write on my phone whichb is kind of crazy when you think about it.

I never thought I Would ever see the day that I works be able to write something the whole world could read tha to was written from a pocket computer
