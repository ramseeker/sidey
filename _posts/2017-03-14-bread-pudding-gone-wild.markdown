BW and baking are usually not a good ‘mix’.




Last night, BW decided she need to make bread pudding. I won’t touch the stuff becasue soggy bread isn’t really my thing but she likes it.




Bread goes in oven. She goes up the computer for a bit and then comes down to check on it and I hear:




“Whoa! It’s not supposed to look like this!!!

I will let you decide if this is bread pudding to you.
