    </code>










After musing about what [apple notebook I would buy](http://www.jim.am/2015/03/MacBook-air-vs-MacBook Pro-what-to-buy-in-2015/) I got to thinking: We all know the soon to be released Apple MacBook is the **lightest Apple computer ever** but what about the other models? How much do they weigh? Does more SSD hard drive space make a computer heavier? What about RAM? Does that make a computer heavier? Let’s have a look:

## The MacBook is the Lightest Apple Computer You can Buy




So there you have it. The lightest Apple computer is the soon to be available MacBook followed by the MacBook Air 11 and 13 inch, and MacBook Pro 13 inch and 15 inch models




## The 27 inch iMac is the Heaviest Computer You can Buy




The lightest desktop computer of course, is the Apple Mac Mini but curiously, the 2.8Ghz model is .1 lb heavier than the other slower Mac Mini models. Interestingly the weight of the Retina 5K iMac is the same weight as the the non-retina iMacs. I would have guessed that the better display would have to weigh more, but I guess resolution does not affect the weight of a computer.




## 15 inch MacBook Pros Still Weigh a Lot {#15-inch-MacBook Pros-still-weigh-a-lot}




It’s surprising to see the weight of the MacBook Pros still weigh as much. A [PowerBook G4](http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/powerbook_g4/specs/powerbook_g4_1.5_15.html) that’s a **over a decade older** only weighs about a lb more, and my guess the big weight saving of that pound are from the removal of the optical drive and traditional hard drive that the new MacBook Pros no longer have. If MacBook Pros had to still have these two things I bet we would still see their weight be closer to six lbs like the PowerBooks were.




No wonder the MacBook Airs were so popular – the 11 inch was the lightest model you could buy until the new MacBook released a week or so ago and were **half the weight** of a 15inch MacBook Pro. I have slugged around enough 5lb notebooks to tell you that it’s no fun after a while on the back and shoulders.




## How Important is Notebook Weight?




When it comes to the new MacBook and it’s lack of weight, I wonder how light a notebook needs to be? Yes, slogging a 5lb notebook around gets old but there’s a big tradeoff with the new MacBook for that little weight, and it’s no MacBook Pro. The screen is very nice, but the keyboard seems to take some time to adjust to and as has been discussed ad nauseum, the lack of ports might be a problem.




If Apple discontinues the MacBook Air lineup, then there’s a big weight jump between the 2lb MacBook and the almost 3.5 lbs the 13 inch MacBook Pro. Currently the MacBook Airs fill the 2-3lbs weight category quite nicely but the design is getting stale so I wouldn’t be surprised to see this lineup go sooner than later.
