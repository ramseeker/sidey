I have canceled and uncanceled my spotify subscription so many times I can’t count but I keep coming back to spotify even though BW and I share [a google play music ](https://play.google.com/music/listen)subscription and it a lot of ways they duplicate each other, but   I find that both have different qualities that I like and so I figure I can find the ten bucks a month it costs to pay for my spotify entertainment.




I especially enjoy the weekly curated ‘discover’ playlist that spotify has as well. Also, this [playlist](https://play.spotify.com/user/wentzie/playlist/10Nbu5IQ7eIhXQEACbcHH9) has probably every song  I grew up with with something like 1000 songs or more, there’s always a song I haven’t heard in years.




Speaking of which U2’s  the[ Joshua Tree ](https://play.spotify.com/album/4mULDK6YXrFXTfSwvwm4M3)was released 30 years ago earlier this week.




30 YEARS! How did that happen?
