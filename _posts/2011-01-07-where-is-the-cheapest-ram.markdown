This is easy. The **[cheapest RAM is right here](http://www.jim.am)**.




Now that we have that out of the way, I need to clarify a bit. First, for the most part I specialize in [Apple Computer Memory Upgrades](http://www.jim.am) for the most part, so if you’re in the market for the cheapest Dell memory, or  HP memory or where to buy cheap memory in Canada let’s say I may or may not be the resource you want. Some of the memory stores I track and monitor memory prices for also [specialize in PC Memory](http://www.memoryx.net), but for the most part I stick to what I know – and that’s Apple computer memory.

If you’re in the market for the cheapest ram to buy I think it’s my duty to advise you that the cheapest ram might not be the deal you think it is. In fact, it’s probably in your best interest to buy RAM from an established memory store or even  better if you’re a Mac user is a [store that specializes in Mac Memory](http://www.macsales.com). You may not buy the cheapest RAM this way but you will get hassle free RAM with lifetime support from memory sellers that actually know what RAM you need to buy – regardless of Mac or PC.




RAM  is so cheap these days,  as long as you buy it from an established computer memory manufacturer, it seems almost silly to worry about whether you saved a few percent over some other store as the price difference from most trusted stores usually only differs about the same as the cost of a cup of coffee.




[Buy RAM](http://www.jim.am/) from a fair  and trusted memory store and you will have no problems with your memory upgrade which is worth more than any savings on RAM you might find from lesser memory resellers. Worry about support and quality –  not the cheapest price.
