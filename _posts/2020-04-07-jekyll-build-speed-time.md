I spent a good part of my evening trying to find a way to speed up the build time of my Jekyll site. I have toyed with the idea of switching to [wordpress](http://www.wordpress.com)  or [Hugo](http://www.gohugo.io ) but the work to try and get my posts from Jekyll to either of these sites would be a pain.

So. I googled and scratched my head a lot and finally found a way to get this site built in under 3 seconds. I am sure I could tweak further, but I'm OK with about 3 seconds.

This site now does not still build instantaneously, but pretty close.
