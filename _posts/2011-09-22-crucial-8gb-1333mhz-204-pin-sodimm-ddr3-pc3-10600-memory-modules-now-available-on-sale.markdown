**[Buy 2x Crucial 8GB 1333Mhz so-dimms](http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT102464BF1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&cjsku=CT102464BF1339) to maximize the performance of your MacBook Pro

I have been waiting for this.![](http://images.crucial.com/images/resources/large/package/204-pinSODIMMDDR3.gif)




You can now buy** [8GB DDR3 1333MHz sodimms from Crucial Technology](http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT102464BF1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&cjsku=CT102464BF1339)** directly and install up to **16GB of Crucial RAM in your MacBook Pro**, Mac Mini, and other PC notebooks that can accept up to 16GB like the MacBook Pro’s Can.




In a way, this isn’t really news and places like [OWC](http://www.jim.am/owc) and [RAMJET](http://www.jim.am/ramjet) have offered 16GB ram kits for the 2011 Apple MacBook Pros for sometime. Since February for OWC if I recall, but this is the first I have seen where you can **buy 8GB crucial sodimms for MacBook to max out your MacBook Pro** way past what Apple suggests and for a pretty good price considering Crucial is a name brand memory manufacturer.




At the time of writing, not only are these Crucial 8gb sodimms finally available to buy online, they’re pretty cheap when you compare the prices to the other vendors that offer 16GB MacBook Pro memory upgrade kits:

Is it worth it to spend over $700 on RAM in 2011? That’s up to you, but I don’t know that I would right now unless you **really need all the speed you can possibly get your hands on**. Usually if you’ve got a MacBook Pro you’re a professiona even when you consider the higher price these 8GB sodimms still demand they’re a bargain when you compare the price of ram against your profits. More RAM allows you to work faster, especially if you’re working with image processing or video.




But these **[8GB 1333Mhz sodimms from Crucial](http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT102464BF1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&cjsku=CT102464BF1339)** are still pretty pricey when you compare to the **[8GB Crucial MacBook Pro Kits](http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339)** that will run you just over $50. (see MacBook Pro Price Chart Above) There are cheaper 8GB upgrades above too in the MacBook Pro Price table but you may want to consider this upgrade over the 8GB option which is considerably cheaper. 4GBx2 DDR3 1333Mhz sodimms are a much better deal than 8GBx2 DDR3 sodimms still in 2011. Who knows what happens in 2012 for ram prices, but my guess is these 8GB Crucial sodimms will drop in price like a stone over the next year, just like the 4GB memory modules did.




Another reason to wait a bit when it comes to upgrading your MacBook Pro to 16GB is that there’s [rumors of new 2012 MacBook Pros](http://www.macrumors.com) down the road and you may be better off waiting until the new Apple Pro notebooks are released so you compare your options: Upgrade your 2011 MacBook Pro – or buy a new 2011 MacBook Pro, which might have the option to install even more RAM than the 16GB limit the MBP’s have today.




But if you are ready to **[buy 16GB of RAM for MacBook Pros](http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT102464BF1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&cjsku=CT102464BF1339)**, the **[Crucial Brand](http://amzn.to/2oA2gjC)** is one of the few brands I can recommend without hesitation.
