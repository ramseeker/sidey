I came out this morning to go to work and I saw this:

Now I am not the handiest guy in the world but somehow this doesn’t look right.




This fence is toast. I had to prop it up with some small pieces of wood and leave it in the closed position all the time as the **last time** it was windy it did this too. So in a way this is not a surprise.




But it seems my ‘fix’ does not withstand gusts up to 60MPH.




It looks like there’s a new fence in our future.




Yay.
