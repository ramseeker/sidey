(unless you configure your MacBook Pro from the Apple Store with the maximum ram already installed)

To increase the performance of your MacBook Pro you need to, or I suggest that you do – add more ram. The newest MacBook Pro’s from Apple allow you to install 8GB of memory in them, and this is regardless of MacBook Pro screen size. 13, 15 and 17 inch MacBook Pro’s all max out at 8GB (my guess is the  2011 MacBook Pros will max out at 16GB, but at the time of writing, this is just a guess)




So the question that is asked is: **[What is the Cheapest RAM for MacBook Pro](http://www.jim.am)**?




This depends on a few variables before I can help answer this question as it depends on whether you are looking to buy name brand memory or generic ram for the MacBook Pros.  With the name brand RAM, such as Crucial Technology (other stores carry name brand memory too, but it’s my policy to list their cheaper generic ram)  you get the satisfaction of a better (perceived, anyway) brand than if you were to buy generic memory.




But don’t discount the generic RAM for MacBook Pro as this memory, in my opinion is not only the cheaper memory option, but I have found works just as well as the name brand stuff, but for much less money, close to 50% off in some instances. The generic memory is still manufactured to the same standards as name brand memory but just doesn’t come with the name brand sticker. You’re still buying ram from a memory store you can trust that offers a lifetime guarantee and have been in business for at very least a decade and specialize in both Apple memory but also PC memory too.




Save some money,  compare prices on MacBook Pro Memory and max out your Apple MacBook Prow with as much ram as it can handle.
