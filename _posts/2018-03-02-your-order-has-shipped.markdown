Here’s one I haven’t done before. Apparently I ordered some stuff on Amazon while putting my phone back in my pocket.




![](http://jim.am/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/null.png)




As almost every human on the planet does these days - the first thing I do is check the phone. Usually, it’s the stupid alarm going off and maybe some eBay auctions ending I have been watching.




But this morning it was the little Amazon shopping cart icon in my notification tray. Funny, I thought - I didn’t order anything.




Well, it seems I had. Yesterday afternoon I was wondering how I was going to mount my stupidly large computer monitor to my [new $25.00 desk](http://jim.am/2018/03/01/the-25-00-desk/) so I was shopping for monitor stands and mounts.




I had the stuff in my shopping cart to see what the total would be. I decided against placing the order and put my phone back in my pocket.




Well, somehow the order got placed and my order is on my way. Great.




It was only $40.00 but that’s not the point. It was also **mortgage day **and as BW is in charge of the finances I’m always afraid the mortgage payment is going to bounce because I stopped at Starbucks.




Thankfully this month payday and mortgage day happened on the same day and pa day beat mortgage day to the bank so crisis averted.




I was able to cancel the order for half the stuff, but I have a[ 100×200 VESA Monitor mount ](http://amzn.to/2GSUXeM)coming tomorrow, because: prime.




I know that now I am an American I am supposed to support the economy and work all the time and buy all the things but shopping in your pocket is a new one for me.




I’m just happy I didn’t have an expensive Apple product in my cart that’s now on the way. BW would have killed me.
