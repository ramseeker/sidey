Remember when we last spoke about how I was in[ trouble with BW?](http://jim.am/i-like-pie/) Well…consider this as part 2, but much, much worse.




You see, a few weekends ago BW left us for professional reasons (and to see how much she could spend on [ubers](https://www.uber.com/)) so once again I was left with this:

(she’s not much help when it comes to cutting the lawn) and the instructions to **eat whatever I wanted.**




So I went to Wegmans and[ bought this](https://www.wegmans.com/products/meat/ready-to-cook/chicken/pork-with-salsa-verde.html) and made some rice and wrapped it all in tortillas and ta-da! I had pretty cheap burritos to last me for the weekend. Add some nachos and perhaps a bit of chocolate for dessert and I’m in bachelor heaven (except for the dog hair).




## What I Didn’t Buy Was This:

See that pie above? That’s a strawberry cream pie.




That pie, sadly (for me) is not my ideal pie. For me, I much prefer a chocolate cake:

In fact, for all my readers  - If it’s chocolate, I’m in. Strawberry, no so much. **Please remember this fact.**




And this is where the fun starts. BW bought me  a strawberry pie and brought it from Salt Lake City with the **pie on her lap! **She travelled all that way with a pie on her lap in an airplane.




For me.




She must **really love me! **




But guess who doesn’t like the strawberry pie that travelled in ubers, airplanes and then our car?  Yes, me.




And this is the part where I get into trouble, again - [about pie](http://jim.am/i-like-pie/)!




I took one bite of the strawberry pie and claimed I don’t like it. **Let’s just say BW wasn’t happy:**




**“What???!! I travelled across the country with a freaking pie on my lap and you don’t like it?**




So, yeah, there’s that.  Trouble for me.




You see in my last post I had stated:




**” I don’t care the flavor as long as it meets the requirement of being round!**




So when BW was at the counter she thought to herself “I will buy my husband a pie”, because in my last post I said** I liked pies** and because it’s on the internet it must be true.




Who can blame her?




Well… I don’t like cream pies. Or strawberry pies.




And right now, **BW doesn’t like me very much**. I doubt I will see another pie for a while and you can pretty much bet I will be writing about other topics from now on in.




Moving on…




## It’s Spring Here In Buffalo!




We have been sunbathing:

And I’ve been saving BW $600 a year by using my solar-powered toy to tame the lawn.




(see BW, I’m good for something )




![image alt text](/public/SagigiHQSTz3vQJRaaZvA_img_4.jpg)




(time for some useless data: my fitbit says it’s 2 miles of walking to mow the lawn)




I had to stop a few times… because of my love of pie. It’s hard work this outdoor labor!




![image alt text](/public/SagigiHQSTz3vQJRaaZvA_img_5.jpg)




Also, see the shed? The one that’s going to eventually fall into the ground thanks to all the bunnies that live under it?




I have been informed that it’s my job to get it reshingled and to **paint it.  ** BW said she’d get back at me for not liking that pie and  she wasn’t fooling.




We’ve had burgers on our $100 barbeque that with the $40 bucks worth of parts I ordered for it, we hope we can get another year out of before it gets dragged to the curb.

So all in all it’s been a pretty good spring here (pie related issues aside) and past few weeks have flown by and April is almost over.




I’m not sure there’s any pie in my near future, but one can hope.




Until next time,




TH and Co.
