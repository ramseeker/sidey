I just picked this up for small desktop computer I have and I have to tell you that it’s worth the seven bucks. It’s hard to imagine that you would need mor than 4 USB ports but by the time you add wireless mice, usb hard drives and a usb keyboard  I didn’t have too many ports left and I found myself having to swap devices out.




This fixes that problem for me.
