You know, the <del>older </del>smarter I get, the less stuff I need. Sure, B would love to move to Paris in a heartbeat, but I’d like to think we’re quite happy here on our little corner of the world . I mean,  if nothing else - we eat well:

Every night B saunters over to me and whispers in my ear those two words every man wants to hear: “Dinner’s Ready!”.




(actually, in reality it’s more like “Jim!, set the table!”, but that didn’t really flow with my story, so I exercised a bit of creative license here in the telling)




And you know, we may not agree on[ buying a car](http://jim.am/she-wants-to-buy-a-mazda-cx-5/)  or [what size water heater](http://jim.am/the-hot-water-heater-fund/), but I have to tell you  it’s true what they say about the way to a man’s heart. I’ve come a long way from plain pasta and toast (still not fond of the eggplant though)




We have an arrangement, B and I. I help her get her day started with coffee and she does the dinner and I do the cleanup.(The blog is called tidy husband for a reason) This isn’t a rule set in stone and there’s been days I cooked. (cheerios) and she’s cleaned but we’ve worked it out that this works better if she does the cookin’ and I do the cleanin’.




And, did I mention that I eat well? And, no eggplant tonight, thank goodness ?




**Houston, We Have Flowers**

For the past six weeks, every night we go out to inspect the garden and every night B complains and goes “ awwwwwww… I don’t have any flowers yet, my neighbors have flowers - how come  I don’t have flowers?”




And like clockwork I remind her that it’s only been a month and these things take time and patience, patience..




Well, as you can see from the photo above we now have a flower in the front yard. The fun part is we have no idea what this thing is other than well, orange. So if any of you can help identify this thing,  we’re curious.




Some days  it’s  just a day where you work hard and look up and it’s dinnertime and today was one of those days: You eat a lovely meal, inspect the garden,play with the dog a bit, come in and blog for an hour (yes, it takes me that long to bang this thing out) and then for me anyway,that’s about the day.




One reason I started this blog was to document the every day. Because the time goes fast and I want to remember that even a day  where the most exciting thing that happened was that ** we had chicken - ** is still pretty cool.  No trips to Paris needed.
