Due to the big snowstorm and BW’s cold we couldn’t get down to Pennsylvania to see family. But, we managed to do OK otherwise and we celebrated the US holiday with just the 2 ([ok, three](http://jim.am/eyelashes/)) of us with big honkin’ steaks the size of my head. I had planned on going outside at some point to grab the photo du jour but I can’t see or feel my toes right now I’m so full and can’t move so here’s my culinary delight.




Now if you’ll excuse me there’s a couch with my name on it.
