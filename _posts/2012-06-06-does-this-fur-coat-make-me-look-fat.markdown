As some of you know, I moved over here to the USA in the new year **and** because I am:






  1. 



An old guy and need less sleep






  1. 



 A sucker






  1. 



A light sleeper




It didn’t take thedog long to realize that if she came over to my side of the bed in the mornings and persistently poked me with her wet nose, I would get up and feed the beast. Now, there’s a few problems with this scenario and they are:






  1. 



It’s 5:30am






  1. 



It’s 5:30am






  1. 



It’s 5:30am




You will see that the dog’s idea of wakey time and mine are a bit  different, and also:  I have no desire for food in the wee hours  but the dog, well she thinks differently.




So now that we have established she won’t take no for an answer, I stumble and mumble out of bed and look for coffee. The dog, after she come back from a quick jaunt in the backyard is all about one thing and **that is food. **

B gave me the instructions: “ Fill the scoop to about  3/4 f ull”. Which for me -  at 5:30 am before coffee translates to “Screw it, close enough”. I don’t measure real well in the wee hours and the dog has been getting more than the prescribed amount. The Dog is  quite happy to accomodate my lax ways of feeding as they are in her favor. The dog eats,  goes back to bed, and I mosey over to my computer and start work and our morning routine is done for another day…but..




**Time Has Not Been Kind. **




It seems, after performing this ritual for the past 5 months **the dog has gained ten pounds** blooming from a svelte 38lbs to a more comfortable 47lbs. I think this is fine, but for B - hoo boy am I in trouble.

We went to the vet and found out  just how much trouble I am in, and now the dog is on B’s diet. But here’s the thing:




The dog food bag suggests **I feed the dog even more than I  have been giving her,** but the vet and this unflattering photo suggests the dog is eating quite enough thank you very much and B and I have been duking it out since, If the vet states she should lose weight, we will follow her suggestions - she’s the pro, afterall.




But what about the Dog food bag? It states that this dog should get 4 cups of  food a day - that’s another 30 percent than I have been giving her . Is it just so they can sell more dog food?




**Time For A Change**




At the rate we’re going, If I were to continue feeding the dog at my rate the dog would weigh 20lbs more on our first year anniversary. I can only imagine would the dog would weigh following  the instructions on the dog food bag. She would not be able to see her feet, (or get up off the floor).




Seeing as we kindof like the dog and want the dog to be a healthy weight, we have dialed back her portions and she’ s just as happy as ever. The Dog Weight Loss Project Begins.. stay tuned.
