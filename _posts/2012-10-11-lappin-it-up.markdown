I’ve been um, on the injured list  the past week and my dog walking responsibilities have been outsourced the past week to doggy daycare, which is great because the dog comes back to us welll..dog tired. No dog following around, just a carcass on the carpet:

But now that I’m on the mend, the time for me to get out and about again has arrived and thedog and I have some catching up to do because who knows what was going on while we were away, so we laced up our shoes, zipped our jacket and went to see what we could see..
