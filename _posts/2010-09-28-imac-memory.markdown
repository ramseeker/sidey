**[Cheapest Apple iMac](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8IO6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ramseeker-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002QQ8IO6)**




I’ve just realized that I have been tracking ram prices on [**iMac Memory**](http://www.jim.am) for over 13 years now starting with the very first iMac, that teal green model with the round mouse that’s so old now you have to wonder if it’s even worthwhile ugrading thew ram on the original Apple iMac.




I tend to focus on the later iMacs models as I’ve found that’s where the demand is and it only makes sense, I think. Chances are, if you’re going to buy an iMac you’ll want to buy a new iMac as technology marches on and the iMacs just keep getting cheaper and yet better too so it’s my suggestion is when you buy an iMac and maybe it’s for back to school or you’re buying an iMac for Christmas (it’ll be here sooner than you think) and the time to upgrade iMac RAM is right when you buy the iMac.




You can ugrade [iMac Memory](http://www.jim.am/memory/iMac_(DDR3_1333)/) in one of two ways: The first being to favor simple over cheap and just order your iMac from Apple and max out the iMac RAM from Apple at the same time. If time is money then this is definitely the easiest way to go, as you’re buying an apple product and filling it with apple branded ram at the same time.  The only problem  with this technique is hoo boy, will you pay. Apple RAM has consistently been higher priced than if you bought iMac RAM elsewhere. The savings can be in the hundereds of dollars, especially when you factor in the fact that 16gb of RAM is a lot of RAM for the iMac and it’s a newer technology and we all know the newer bigger ram is the most expensive  RAM you can buy.




The better solution is to buy Apple authorized generic  (or name brand to, but you’ll save less) from memory stores that have been in business for more than a decade and have been selling and suppprting iMac RAM since the beginning of the Apple iMac’s existence.




Heck, even the folks at the Apple Store suggest ramseeker as your destination for RAM because Apple only stocks new and in production products – if you’re looking to uprgrade an older Apple iMac you’re out of luck .




But the good new is new or old Apple iMac, I’ve got a selection of Memory stores that yes, will be happy for your business but actually support and sell memory specific to Apple’s  own memory specifications and the kicker is the iMac RAM from these guys is gauranateed to work!




We all know a gaurantee might not mean much depending on the source but this is just one more reason ramseeker should be your first stop when shoppping for iMac RAM. I don’t list every memory store possible. I only list memory stores that back their product with a gaurantee and have been in business for over a decade (some, two decades) and know RAM for iMacs like the backs of their hands.




That’s how you get the best deal on iMac RAM.  Comparing ram prices from reputable memory stores and buying iMac RAM from a memory store you can trust.
