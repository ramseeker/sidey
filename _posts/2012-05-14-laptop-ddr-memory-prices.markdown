This will be a short one. Almost every notebook pc built today in 2012 will use and accept DDR3 notebook memory and this applies to all brands of laptops – even the Mac vs PC – it doesn’t matter. And of course, you did know that laptop memory prices continue to drop over time and if you ever needed to buy RAM for your notebook, this is the time to do it.

If you’ve been waiting for RAM prices to drop until they fall in price, now is the time to buy because they actually have been rising in price over the last few weeks so I would get into making your laptop go faster with RAM while you can. RAM prices may not continue to be so low.
