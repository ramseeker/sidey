If there’s been one change I have had this year since getting hitched this winter (_note to self, six months coming up - buy flowers_) it’s that I never, ever get lonely. Either people are in our house or we, in theirs.




This past week alone, we will have hosted 3 times by the time the week ends. I’m not used to this - all these people around me, **all the time**?




Now, this is all tongue in cheek and all -  but between hosting and [painting](http://jim.am/rule-number-1/) there sure isn’t a whole lot of ‘me’ time lately (that, and fixing computer problems for BW, but we’ll leave that alone…[hoo boy touchy subject](http://jim.am/im-a-mac/))




Take this Tuesday, for example. We had company, or visitors and it was my family that came to see me. They brought gifts, and of course we had a lovely time as we spent time together away from the TV:

All is not bad on the Island of Grand, though because when we host or get hosted, one thing happens time and time again, and that is: **we eat well.** A little too well, methinks:

If you can’t read the numbers, that’s OK. Let’s just pretend they’re low. My point is that with all this social dining lately, I think I am starting to feel gravity’s pull a touch more than I am used to.




I blame the following:




[![Burgers](http://jim.am/images/2012/07/JIM_6987.jpg)](http://jim.am/images/2012/07/JIM_6987.jpg)




Burgers with Blue Cheese Dressing

Grilled Sirloin Steak

This might have something to do with my weight increase too I think.




If you recall, when I started this blog I told you [we did this](http://jim.am/we-run/). Well, it’s been some time since that actually happened let me tell you, and much to BW’s dismay we have to start again. There’s a fine line between fat and happy, and well - **just fat.**




The takeaway is that all this socializing comes with a price, and that price has to be paid in 2 mile daily increments or else.. like I said, **fat**.




I guess that this is a small price to pay for visiting with your friends and family, and truth be told - it’s priceless. But all this socializing sure is hard on a (former) skinny guy’s waistline.
