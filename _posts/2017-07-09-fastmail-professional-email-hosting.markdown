The problem I have found with having a server for your wordpress site is you lose an eMail server. I’ve tried using Go Daddy for email hosting but I never liked it.




Then I stumbled across fastmail and it suits me just fine. It costs me a few bucks a month but they offer both a web-based and apps for your phone too.




It’s seemingly working just fine and I don’t have to think about email any more
