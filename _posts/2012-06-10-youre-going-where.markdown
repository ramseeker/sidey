When B and I first met, one of the first things that struck each other was our accents. I say Maaaazda and paaaaasta all wrong apparently  and for her - it’s dooooollar. Also, she did not know about touques:

But, once we figured out that while, we may have to ask questions at least we will be able to understand each other - the next thing we learned about each other is what we do for our professions and to this day I still have no idea what B does for a living exactly. I have an idea and overall theme if you will but I have no reasonable explanation for the bomb that got dropped on me last month:




**” I want to go to Uruguay”** . (It’ s OK if you want to stop here and go look up where exactly Uruguay is because I had to as well - I’ll wait)




Now of course, I wasn’t expecting that when I heard “ We have to talk” (Lord, do I dread those words) I thought I would be painting, which come to think of it - **that’s what it did mean,** but I’ll get to that in a minute….




You  see, it seems there’s some big “everybody will be there, I have to go” convention going on and of course, B had to go. As you can imagine, a round trip ticket to Uraguay is not cheap and we could have a [water heater](http://jim.am/the-hot-water-heater-fund/) for the same price, but guys - she has the career. Me, I’m just taking it one day at a time.




I tried to explain the need for regular bathing and hot water and that there’s the internet and email and skype and all kinds of ways to save over $1000 on travel but, well.. we all know how this story goes:




Safe Travels, B. The house seems real big without you.




**While You Were Away. **




Some of us in the household can’t be traipsing around the world , (ahem) and [have duties that seemingly never end](http://jim.am/we-need-a-bigger-fridge/) and with that in mind I thought I’d share the results of my manual labor and a few tips:






  1. 



You will get a sunburn if you don’t wear sunscreen. Believe me, I know.






  1. 



 You might need a new pair of boots:

  1. When ordering paint it helps to have them **stain the paint before you buy it and take it home**. Ask me how I know this.

  1. You will paint miles and miles of railing trim

  1. Whoever invented unpainted lattice trim is the devil.

  1. The end results look pretty good. Total time: 2 days by the time the brushes got put away.
