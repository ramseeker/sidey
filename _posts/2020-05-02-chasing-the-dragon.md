I'm a guy. I like technology. The wife, she hates it and just wants it to work.

Me? I want the fastest/best/brightest I can get for my dollar. Which brings me to audio and lately the slippery slope called headphones listening.

I've always been a stereo guy and have amplifiers and speakers and the like but lately due to the fact that **I live with people** and that one of those persons is just about to walk any day now:

I thought that if I just put the speaker grills on then my speakers would be toddler safe. Silly me. The stereo is going away for a while.

This means I have been using headphones at my desk in my little man cave/home ofice and have been buying and trying different headphones and amplifiers to see what I like. For the most part, I buy used so I lose very little on the sale if I don't like it I can just return it and buy something else.

And today my new headphone amplifier came and...it's awesome. It's the [SMSL SP200](https://amzn.to/2WnD6FR) and there is **zero** hiss, noise, pops or even 'flavor' that some other amplifiers have. You get the music just as it was intended to be. I have other amplifiers that sound a little warmer or 'fun' whatever that means but I suggest this amp for a nice clean sound.

And this brings me to this: I'm done.

It took me a few months but I have found the headphone and amplifier system that **works for me**. Music is very, very subjective and you can go **deep** chasing the dragon looking for the best sound possible and if I was in my 20's and single I probably would spend entire paychecks at the stereo store (stereo stores....remember them?) but for the hour or so after wife and kid go to bed I have the gear I need to relax and undwind and **listen to the music**  - and gear - I already have.

This dragon chasing is a sneaky thing. Especially with stereos - more money does not equal better sound sometimes. My little amplifier I love is made in China and is a cheap amp with great technology. It's well built and works well. It doesn't have some brand name ** **cough, (bose)** that you are paying for.

But for me to get better sound I would have to spend **considerably more** that my little wonder from China on my desk. This applies to a lot of other hobbies - are golf clubs that are twice as much in cost improve your game 2x? Probably not. The same goes with stereos - The technology has been the same for a long time and yes, there are improvements and there are those [that measure](http://www.audiosciencereview.com) those improvements but for some of us we just want to play [hotel california](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel_California) one more time and have it sound like we remembered it on that old stereo.

So, for the most part I'm done. I have some headphones, hotel california sounds pretty good and the kid is in bed asleep.

Someone else can chase the dragon. I'm too tired.
