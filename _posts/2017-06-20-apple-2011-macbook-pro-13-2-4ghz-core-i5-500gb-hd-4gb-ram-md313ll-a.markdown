The 2011 MacBook Pro has become affordable enough that even if you cannot afford a new MacBook pro you can still buy an older model that offers close to the same performance as new models [for about $400.00](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?ff3=4&toolid=11800&pub=5575019070&campid=5337133045&mpre=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2FApple-2011-MacBook-Pro-13-2-4GHz-Core-I5-500GB-HD-4GB-RAM-MD313LL-A-Warranty-%2F131509116674%3Fhash%3Ditem1e9e8ddf02%3Ag%3Alz0AAOSwrklVZ2SX). If you add a few upgrades you can have a very capable machine.




RAM is the first upgrade I suggest. This model ships with just 4GB and you can double the ram on the 2011 Macbook Pro 13 inch to 8Gb [for about $50.00](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?ff3=4&toolid=11800&pub=5575019070&campid=5337133045&mpre=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fsch%2Fi.html%3F_from%3DR40%26_trksid%3Dp2047675.m570.l1312.R1.TR11.TRC2.A0.H0.X8gb%2B.TRS1%26_nkw%3D8gb%2Bsodimm%2Bkit%26_sacat%3D0).




The hard drive is the really weak spot on this particular machine. It ships with a 500GB drive but I suggest you replace it with a much faster SSD drive. 500GB SSD drives are now priced at [under $200.00](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?ff3=4&toolid=11800&pub=5575019070&campid=5337133045&mpre=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fsch%2Fi.html%3F_from%3DR40%26_trksid%3Dp2047675.m570.l1312.R1.TR11.TRC2.A0.H0.X8gb%2B.TRS1%26_nkw%3D8gb%2Bsodimm%2Bkit%26_sacat%3D0). If that’s too much a 256GB SSD is priced at about half price at[ $100 or so.](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?ff3=4&toolid=11800&pub=5575019070&campid=5337133045&mpre=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fsch%2Fi.html%3F_odkw%3D500gb%2Bssd%26_osacat%3D0%26_from%3DR40%26_trksid%3Dp2045573.m570.l1313.TR8.TRC1.A0.H0.X250gb%2Bssd.TRS0%26_nkw%3D250gb%2Bssd%26_sacat%3D0)




The battery is the last update I would suggest. This a six year old portable computer and it will cost from [$30-50 for a replacement ](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?ff3=4&toolid=11800&pub=5575019070&campid=5337133045&mpre=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fsch%2Fi.html%3F_odkw%3D250gb%2Bssd%26_osacat%3D0%26_from%3DR40%26_trksid%3Dp2045573.m570.l1313.TR11.TRC1.A0.H0.X2011%2Bmacbook%2Bpro%2Bbattery.TRS0%26_nkw%3D2011%2Bmacbook%2Bpro%2Bbattery%26_sacat%3D0)depending on whether you opt for a 3rd party battery vs a Genuine OEM model




If you add the total cost to spruce up this computer your’re looking at about $700.00 for a MacBook Pro with a fast SSD, maxed out ram and a new battery. At this price you might consider just buying a new MacBook Pro but that’s your choice. If you already own this model of MacBook pro then the upgrades are reasonable and will get you a few more years out of your MacBook Pro 13
