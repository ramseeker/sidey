As in: you have to be brave to go out into it. In the meantime I'm staying in until all this
COVID-19 stuff is over for the most part as my job was deemed "non essential" by the
governor of new york. 

I have a cold, but it's **just a cold** and not much to worry about. I hope. 

In the meantime, I'm screwing around with an attempt to blog from my iPad
but I don't know if I want to pay for all the apps to be able to do so. We shall see. 

In the meantime, this post is the equivalent of testing testing...123.
