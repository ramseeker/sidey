It probably isn’t.




I was in a 2012 Honda Civic tonight and right on the console above the radio was written in big letters:** Premium Stereo Sound**




Let’s just clarify:  I was in a Honda. A base Civic. Not a Lexus, Beemer even the Honda premium brand  - Acura.




If I was in one of those brands then one might expect since you’re riding around in  a car worth about the same as my house one would expect the radio to sound nice and a brand might be associated with the sound like Bose, Harmon Kardon, etc.




But I was in a Civic. How premium could one expect or even want? I think that my requirements in a car stereo would be that it works, has a volume knob (I hate push buttons) and because it’s 2018 - bluetooth.




The rest doesn’t matter




This must work though. I mean Honda (and others) have been at it for a while so surely somebody in marketing said “Be sure to get that premium sound screen printed on the dashboard” at some meeting.




I wonder if this works?




Do people read their dashboard and feel better knowing they shelled out the big bucks and the dash has some words to remind you how the stereo sounds? Shouldn’t the stereo  have to prove itself like the rest of the car?




You don’t see the tires printed with letters on them that state that they offer premium grip, or how about the steering wheel? - would the lettering on that be “ premium circular shape” for extra control.




Or what about the rest of the dashboard? The heater and a/c controls don’t get any respect either. There was not a word about them anywhere and if it were my choice, I would **much rather **have heat than a stereo.  If the stereos’ broken I can hum, but if the heat doesn’t work I freeze to death.




It all seems silly to me that we’re so influence by brands and also what the brands say. If my made in china shirt has a logo then it’s fashion. If the same shirt comes in a six pack I picked up from target then it’s of lesser quality?




Perhaps I’m not the market for an entry level Honda and that the people they market to **want** to be told the stereo is good - I don’t know.




What I do know that you can’t always believe what’s on the label.
