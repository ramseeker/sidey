And the award for sexiest man of 2013 goes to.. (well, nevermind -  BW thinks so and that’s all that matters). Also, has anybody seen my sandals to go with these socks?




Anyway,  I thought I’d pull up my socks and get to writing a ‘best of’ for 2013. 




We were lucky this year. Sure, the dog peed on the floor once or twice, the new car is well broken in and the wet basement repair and the garage door broke all the same week but that’s nothing that money can’t fix. What’s important is we survived this:

This is when BW was knocked out for two weeks or more with a concussion. I never worried so much. Sorry, BW but no skating for you from now on.




Then for a very short time I got a J.O.B selling these:

but that didn’t last too long - just as well. Hey, I tried. Also we got a great deal on one too. We didn’t even test drive it. It’s a small SUV - what’s to test drive? The requirement was for the dog to fit in the back and us in the front and after our week with the concussion to have a car that starts reliably. If you’re one of the friends that helped schlep us around to doctors when BW was sick - thank you again.




And then you before you know it, it’s springtime and BW had me working again in the garden.

With much complaining on my part. (did I mention I hate gardening?).

We enjoyed lots of the simple pleasures - like trips to the park for mexican:

And then, BW left me for six weeks or so to go research on the other side of the planet, and she left me with this:




[![JIM_1779](http://jim.am/images/2013/07/JIM_1779.jpg)](http://jim.am/images/2013/07/JIM_1779.jpg)




and while she was away I used this,

and this




[![JIM_2057](http://jim.am/images/2013/07/JIM_2057.jpg)](http://jim.am/images/2013/07/JIM_2057.jpg)




and I painted these:

I also ate well:

[![JIM_2127](http://jim.am/images/2013/07/JIM_2127.jpg)](http://jim.am/images/2013/07/JIM_2127.jpg)




kept good care of the garden:




[![JIM_2064](http://jim.am/images/2013/07/JIM_2064.jpg)](http://jim.am/images/2013/07/JIM_2064.jpg)




and then before you know it - the summer is over and she’s back home where she belongs:




[![JIM_2293](http://jim.am/images/2013/08/JIM_2293.jpg)](http://jim.am/images/2013/08/JIM_2293.jpg)




and I was able to prove to her that I can keep her flowers alive (better than the garden that’s for sure).

I also had a wee battle with the mice in the garage this year:




[![JIM_2281](http://jim.am/images/2013/08/JIM_2281.jpg)](http://jim.am/images/2013/08/JIM_2281.jpg)




and it did get a bit hot when BW was away:




[![JIM_2172](http://jim.am/images/2013/07/JIM_2172.jpg)](http://jim.am/images/2013/07/JIM_2172.jpg)




and summer 2013 was over and the fall is where we got busy on other projects.




I taught a five (six?) year old how to play road hockey, BW got a business card with an even fancier title, we sold the older car:




[![JIM_2309](http://jim.am/images/2013/12/JIM_2309.jpg)](http://jim.am/images/2013/12/JIM_2309.jpg)




and I got to work on a few new projects now that all my chores were done.




Also later this fall I started to pick up a camera again because we missed being able to look back and laugh at all the silly things we do and this is a great place to share then with friends and family.

So now with just hours to go before the end of the year - what’s the plan for Tidy Husband in 2014? Well,making more money and getting skinnier would be nice but I hope to write here more. More than once I have given up but I keep coming back as it’s fun to write these kind of posts where we just share the everyday, and in 2014 we’ve got 365 of ‘em.




It should be fun.




Happy New Year!




Tidy Husband, and Family.
