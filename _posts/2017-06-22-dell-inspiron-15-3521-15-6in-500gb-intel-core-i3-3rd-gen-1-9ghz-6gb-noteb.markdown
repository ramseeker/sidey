This computer sells for [about $100.00](http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2047675.m570.l1313.TR12.TRC2.A0.H0.XDell+Inspiron+15-3521.TRS0&_nkw=Dell+Inspiron+15-3521&_sacat=0) as configured, but then with a few upgrades you could do to get a bit more life out of it.




**RAM**: This Dell Inspiron ships with 6GB of RAM but you can max out the ram to 16GB. For this computer I wonder if adding ram that costs **more than the computer **is such a good idea. You could upgrade to 8GB but as it ships with 6GB you would be hard pressed to tell much of a difference




**Hard Drive: **This is different. This computer ships with a 500GB drive, but I suggest you toss a SSD in this computer. You could get away with a 128GB ssd which would cost[ $100 or less](http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_sacat=0&_nkw=128gb+ssd&_frs=1).




**Battery**: This computer could probably use a new battery and these are pretty cheap at about $20.00




**Total Cost of Dell Inspiron 15-3521 with Upgrades would cost about $220.00**




**Shop Dell Inspiron 15-3521 on [eBay](http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_odkw=Dell+Inspiron+15-3521&_osacat=0&_from=R40&_trksid=p2045573.m570.l1313.TR0.TRC0.H0.TRS0&_nkw=Dell+Inspiron+15-3521&_sacat=0) or [Amazon](http://amzn.to/2rGRubM)**
