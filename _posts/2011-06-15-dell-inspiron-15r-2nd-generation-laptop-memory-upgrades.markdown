**[Dell Inspiron 2nd Generation Notebooks from $499.](http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-1548159-10550055?url=http%3A%2F%2Flt.dell.com%2Flt%2Flt.aspx%3FACD%3D%25za-%25zp-%25zs%26AID%3D%25zp%26CID%3D24471%26LID%3D566643%26DGC%3DCJ%26DGSeg%3DDHS%26DURL%3DHTTP%3A%2F%2Fconfigure.us.dell.com%2Fdellstore%2Fconfig.aspx%3Foc%3Dfncor05%2526cs%3D19%2526c%3DUS%2526l%3DEN%2526m_29%3DFQ1O&cjsku=FNCOR05_1)

The **[2nd generation of Dell Notebooks](http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10639500)** with a 15 inch LCD display offer two features over the [Dell Inspiron 15R N5010](http://www.jim.am/dell-inspiron-15r-n5010-memory-upgrades/) and that’s a **faster processor inside this dell laptop** as well as (something I could care less about, but I’m probably not the market for this dell notebook anyway) and that’s the fact that the lids or top cover of this 15 inch notebook from **Dell offers switch lids**, and if you’ve got thirty bucks or so you can swap out the colors of your dell to personalize it further and make it stand out from other Dells, but I’d rather spend the switch lids money on something that will get you computing faster with the 2nd generation Dell 15R notebook computer, and that’s **adding more RAM**.




**Cheapest RAM Prices for Dell Inspiron 15R 2nd Generation**




![Dell Inspiron 15R Laptop Computer](http://i.dell.com/das/dih.ashx/314x314/images/global/products/314x314/inspiron-15r-right-black-alternate-314.jpg)




This is probably one of the [best selling dell notebook computers](http://www.jim.am/what-is-the-best-computer-brand-to-buy/) in 2011 thanks to the fact that it’s priced at under $500 at $499,  but I’d go and spend the additional $50 and buy the $549.00 Dell 15R as opposed to the older and slower model that doesn’t have as fast as a processor **when comparing the two 15 inch Dell notebooks side by side**.




At $549, the Dell packs a fair bit of notebook computer value and when you consider the fact a MacBook Pro 15 inch is $2000 or more –  a $500 notebook looks pretty good in 201.  The main features of the Dell Inspiron 15R  include the switch lids I mentioned above, but also is enabled for Widi and 3DTV that allows you to wirelessly project  your movies to your HDTV. You can buy the  Dell Inspiron 15R with 2nd generation Intel Core i7 processors, **more RAM**, bigger hard drives and add printers, monitors and other to your shopping cart, but at  $549 you’ll limited to an Intel Core i3 processor, **4GB of DDR3 1333Mhz RAM** which is actually a very usable RAM amount  and  for every day home use and web browsing like facebook, etc, it’s quite possible you won’t need to upgrade the RAM on the Dell Inspiron 15R.




But, I recommend two things: That you do buy more dell memory and you don’t buy  the RAM from Dell as it’s priced too much. 4GB DDR3 memory of which you’ll need two of to max out the RAM on a Dell 15R 2nd generation will set you back over $200 or more, where alternately you can **[buy the maximum RAM of 8GB for well under $100](http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339)** and save closer to $200 on Dell memory uprades, all by taking 5 minutes to  shop around for the best prices on RAM Upgrades from memory vendors you can trust and are reputable, as that’s the only kind of RAM and  memory I recommend.




All this advice only applies to saving money on RAM upgrades on the Dell Inspiron 2nd generation 15R (which looks like a great deal on a windows 7 notebook) and if you’ve got deep pockets or don’t have the time to install the ram yourself (it’s easy to do a memory upgrade  on most any Dell computer – just pop the battery out, and there’s a cover on the bottom of the notebook you remove to acesss the two memory upgrade slots available) then you may  be better off just configuring the RAM when you buy the Inspiron online from Dell, but for those of us that want to save money on Dell Memory Upgrades, regardless s of specific model number.




To upgrade the RAM on Dell Inspiron 15R 2nd generation you’ll need to **[buy two 4GB DDR3 1333mhz sodimms](http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&cjsku=CT51264BC1339)**, usually sold in **[8GB notebook memory upgrade kits](http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339)** that make it easy to upgrade the two slots available for upgrade on this affordable Dell designed for every day home and small office use.




**Dell Inspiron 15R 2nd Generation Deals and Best Prices **




Your best bet for a **deal on a dell notebook** is to buy it [directly from Dell](http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10639500) where you can configure your dell laptop with added software such as [Microsoft Home and Office](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0050PJB32/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ramseeker-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399373&creativeASIN=B0050PJB32), faster processors, bigger hard drives and even add extra switchable lids if that’s your thing, but I also recommend you check out Amazon for the **[best notebook computer deals](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fbestsellers%2Felectronics%2F565108%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dzg_bs_nav%23&tag=ramseeker-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957)** as well.
