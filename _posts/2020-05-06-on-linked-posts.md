I always thought linked posts were kind of lame as it take less than a minute to link to stuff and usually pull a quote out of somebody else's site and then link to it.

So now, I am doing it. I have done it in the [past](https://jim.am/array-themes) so this really isn't all that new afterall and I prefer to write my own content but if you see an arrow after the title then it's a linked post.

I really just want a way to stay organized and link to stuff that interests me. I figure if it interests me then maybe you will like it too.
