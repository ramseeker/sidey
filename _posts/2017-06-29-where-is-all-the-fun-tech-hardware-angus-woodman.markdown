Angus Woodman on the lack of fun tech hardware these days.




<blockquote>You of course can always mod your stuff to be more fun. There’s a company that’ll paint tech hardware for you. You may also say, “well, you can add your personality with a case or covers or stickers.” And that’s fine for some, but to me it still feels like slapping an “I love boobies” bumper sticker on an S-Class.

He’s right. It’s been some time since I saw any new tech that I had to have  just because it was fun. I too, miss the clamshell iBooks.
