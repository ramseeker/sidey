Here’s something I learned today fromRic Ford at [Macintouch](https://www.macintouch.com/forums/showthread.php?tid=914&pid=21401#pid21401)




<blockquote>The same thing occurs with monitors connected via Mini DisplayPort (which is also the Thunderbolt connector) to a 2011, 2012 or 2015 MacBook Pro [in clamshell mode]. No power adapter, no external display image.
