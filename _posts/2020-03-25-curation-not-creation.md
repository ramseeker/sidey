![ipad](/images/ipad.jpg )

I was gifted an [iPad](https://amzn.to/2wCjXr2) recently and after a few days getting it set up to my liking I thought i would try creating a blog post or two on it. 

Spoiler: I can't. 

It's too hard for me to navigate between all the different apps and windows to get a simple post like this published. 

I tried, I really did. 

Now, I use [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) to write this blog so it's a bit more complicated than using [Wordpress](http://wordpress.com) where I could install a dedicated app and be done with it where I could just enter a title and write the post. 

But with my jekyll site like this I find it's easier to just use a **real computer**. Heck even my [Chromebook](https://amzn.to/3dup514) works for this better than the iPad.

I googled and searched and read some other blogs and sites that say that **they** did it so it must be possible, but I am just not feeling it. 

I know that Apple wants us to believe the iPad is the second coming and it's a personal computer but for my use case it's just **not for me** and I prefer a more traditonal computer using [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com)  as my OS of choice where I can write in the terminal or use any text editor of choice and know I can get a quick post **actually published** 

This doesn't mean I won't get a lot of use out of my iPad, but just not for content creation. I will leave that for others.
