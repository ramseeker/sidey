After yesterday’s fiasco with the [bookcase](http://jim.am/2018/03/05/the-bookcase/) at very least I can share some good news from our recent adventures on craigslist.




While at the dealer shopping for ill fitting furniture, we also found this candle holder thing that we are both not sure if it’s really ugly or we like it.




Here, decide for yourself:

It’s about 2 feet across and although we don’t have them yet there’s four little holders for small candles.




It costs us five bucks, so it was really a no brainer.

We needed something to for the space next to the TV because the TV isn’t centered in the room because we need it to cover the breaker panels behind.




I had suggested a clock but this works well too. And it’s hard to beat the price. Heck, it’s cheaper than paint.
