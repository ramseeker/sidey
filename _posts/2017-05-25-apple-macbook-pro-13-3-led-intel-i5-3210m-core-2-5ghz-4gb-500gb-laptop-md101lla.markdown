![](https://jim.am/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/s-l500-300x300.jpg)The Apple MacBook Pro 13.3” LED Intel i5-3210M Core 2.5GHz 4GB 500GB Laptop MD101LLA sells for [about $600.00](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?ff3=4&toolid=11800&pub=5575019070&campid=5337133045&mpre=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2FApple-MacBook-Pro-13-3-LED-Intel-i5-3210M-Core-2-5GHz-4GB-500GB-Laptop-MD101LLA-%2F351657487360%3Fhash%3Ditem51e06b6c00%3Ag%3AvsoAAOSwWTRWxlqQ)




This 2012 non-retina Macbook Pro is a bit on the old side now but it’s still got a lot of life left if you added a few upgrades:




## 2012 MacBook Pro RAM




This MacBook Pro ships with just 4GB of RAM but it can accept at least [double to 8GB](http://amzn.to/2qjh6Ll) with ease for about $50.00




## 2012 MacBook Pro Drive Upgrades




You have 2 options when it comes to upgrading the 2012 MacBook Pro Hard Drives:






  1. 


Add a spinning hard drive to **at least** double the capacity to 1TB of storage if not more. This is a pretty cheap upgrade at [about $50.00](http://amzn.to/2qZPo9u)





  2. 


Add a SSD Drive. This is much faster than a regular drive and although you don’t get the capacity of the spinner, you do gain a lot of speed making the MacBook Pro much faster. SSD Drives are [about $100](http://amzn.to/2qZPo9u) for 256GB models and $200 for 500Gb capacity







## Other 2012 MacBook Pro Upgrades




As this is an older MacBook Pro you might want to consider a few upgrades other than RAM and storage:




Get a replacement power cord. These cost[ about $30.00](http://amzn.to/2qSMWBj).




Get a new battery. Battery life on a 5 year old computer is bound to be worse than at release time. You’re good to go with a replacement though at[ about $30.00](http://amzn.to/2qjseaT)




Lastly, don’t forget to protect your MacBook Pro from bumps and scratches with a [protective sleeve](http://amzn.to/2qStxjH) and if you need more screen real estate adding a second monitor is a great way[ to increase your productivity](http://amzn.to/2r00Py8) too.
