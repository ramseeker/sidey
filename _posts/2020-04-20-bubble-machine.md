We finally had time (and the nice weather) to get the [bubble machine](https://amzn.to/2KkVFoL) she got for easter out for it's inaugural run. And, it was a hit!

A big hit.

Probaby the funniest part of our evening with a bubble machin when she would hum to the machine and making the exact same sound that this little battery operated toy from China makes (batteries not included).

I'm surprised we made it this far today. She napped for maybe 20 minutes and I tried to get her to go down again with no luck so I am surprised that after dinner she had it in her to play with bubbles.

But as soon as the bubble machine was done, so was she.
