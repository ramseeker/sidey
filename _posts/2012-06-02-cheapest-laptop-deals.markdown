I like to shop for memory upgrades being the first thing I tend to look for, but there are times when you need to buy a brand new laptop and with the prices for notebooks continually dropping as more and more features get added over time.




**[The Acer Aspire is one of many cheap laptops available today](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007G7CO2C/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ramseeker-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B007G7CO2C)

**Where to Find The Best Laptop Deals**




I’ve always like the good folks at [dealnews](http://www.dealnews.com) to help me find a deal on PC notebooks especially, and if you’re interested in Apple products, [Mac Prices](http://www.macprices.net) does a great job on updating you on the latest Apple deals on Apple Notebooks  and other Apple products too.




eBay is a great place to look for a notebook deal, especially if you can manage the idea of buying a used notebook – folks upgrade their notebooks all the time and when they do they often sell the old notebooks on eBay or Craigslist which is another great  place to look for notebooks.




I find the easiest way to find a great deal on a notebook is to just shop at Amazon, and the last time I was in the market for a notebook,  I just used their best selling notebooks feature to scan the most popular notebook deals of the hour as the list  continually gets updated over time  and if it’s a popular notebook there’s usually a reason and others have bought the exact same notebook and kept it – The deal sites for laptops and the like may offer and calculate great discounts on notebooks, but that doesn’t mean it’s a good notebook. It means it’s a cheap laptop.




Amazon offers the best prices on Laptops continually. Here’s a few of the current best selling cheap notebook computers:




The Acer Aspire AS5750Z-4835 15.6-Inch Laptop offers a really good price and is one of the cheapest laptops you can buy.




The ASUS A53U-EH11 is another cheap laptop on sale today:




And the new Samsung Chromebook is another way to get into a problem free laptop:




These are just 3 of the cheapest and best selling laptops you can buy today. See the best selling laptops for **[up to the minute laptop deals](http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/electronics/565108/?ie=UTF8&tag=ramseeker-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957)**.
