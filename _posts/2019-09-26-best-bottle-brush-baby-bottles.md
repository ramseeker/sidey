My little one uses formula so we need bottles, nippes, lids and so on and one thing we seem to go through at an alarming rate are bottle brushes as they seem to wear down over time and I rarely get a month out of one if that. 

So far, we've been using the OXO brand brush but at [about ten dollars](https://amzn.to/2lggMj0) it's not the cheapest so I began to look around for alternatives that are **cheaper**.

I found the [Dr. Brown's Bottle Brush, Blue ](https://amzn.to/2lo9UjO) for under $4.00 and seeing as we go though about one a month that could end up saving us close to $40.00 a year. 

Considering that it apparently costs over $250,000.00 to raise a kid I will take every saving I can get when it comes to raising her.
