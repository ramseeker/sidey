She got her shots today for her 4 month visit at the pediatrician and she's been pretty fussy. Not full on screaming, but just fussy.

It's been a long night.

It started at 2:30 am, and continued through until now at 6am and there doesn't seem to be any fever so I guess we will just duke it out and hope or improvement.

As luck would have it she's now just fallen asleep just as my alarm went off and I have to start to get ready to go to work.

But, I'm a new parent. I am supposed to be tired.

I've actually been blessed with this child as she's slept through the night almost since the day she's come home so I guess I can sacrifice a few hours sleep.
