Mondays are hard. I work a 12 hour shift so it’s really hard to come home and find the motivation to write or even trickier - what to write.




But here I am because I can’t miss a day with this little project. I told BW that some days are going to be better than others when it comes to blog posts and this is not one of those days.




The weather was weird for January with 47 degrees and fog.




Here’s a photo. I’m going to bed.
