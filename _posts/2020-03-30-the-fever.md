As if it wasn't stressfull enough with the entire family having to [stay indoors](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/amid-ongoing-covid-19-pandemic-governor-cuomo-announces-nys-pause-functions-extended-next-two) for at least another month, now 2 out of 3 are sick in this house. 

BW has a fever of 101 -point something and so does the pumpkin, and that's the real scary part: Adults can dose themselves and diagnose themselves for the
most part, but infants can't and all you can do is *guess* what is wrong and it's hard. It's hard to [parent while sick](https://jim.am/on_parenting_while_sick/)
and it's hard to parent when your kiddo is sick too. 

Heck, it's hard to parent. So, back to the fever: 

It started a few days for the wifey and to be honsest we just went 'meh' because we figured that it was just well, a cold and few days of r and r combined with some Tylenol and we sould be back to our old ways of annoying each other, but it seems she just can't shake it yet. 

With the little one, she started to get fussy about noon today but it took her until about 3pm after I managed to settle down and take a bit of a nap that we realized that she too had a fever. 

For those that are counting along: that's 2/3 of the occupants. 

Thankfully, all of us are breatyhing well and except for this **fever** we have no other [symptoms of COVID-19.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html). 

According to the site, we should seek medical treatment: 

> If you develop emergency warning signs for COVID-19 get medical attention immediately. Emergency warning signs include*:

> Trouble breathing
Persistent pain or pressure in the chest
New confusion or inability to arouse
Bluish lips or face
*This list is not all inclusive. Please consult your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning.  

And we are all breathing just fine here thank you very much. :) 

Hopefully all this fever stuff will pass soon and just a bit of [Tylenol](https://amzn.to/3dJxuxB) will fix all of our ills. 

Stay safe out there!
