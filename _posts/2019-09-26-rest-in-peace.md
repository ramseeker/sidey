The dog died the other day.

She made it to 11 and a half years which is pretty good I guess in dog years. Heck, if I make it that far I would be okay with that (careful what I wish for)

I had never lived with a dog before and we first met I was **very afraid** of her thinking I would get bitten but after time I realized that there was no chance of that when we were playing and I had my entire hand in her mouth without any care. 

Like all dogs, she was a loyal friend. Well behaved, and she didn't get into **too much trouble**. She never went to the bathroom indoors and didn't run away and would come when called. 

She loved to play ball, guard our back yard and bark at the UPS guy. She will be missed.
