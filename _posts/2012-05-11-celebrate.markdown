B had her students over for an end of school year party last night and they’re good kids and all that jazz but it’s been some time since I spent any time in a room full of college students. B is used to it as this is her everyday but for somebody who stays home all day in the quiet suburbs - **I’m not used to the noise. Holy. **




But, I survived and it’s good to have B home for the summer now and not stressed out beyond belief  due to a hectic teaching schedule. This is better. I have some pretty cool leftovers for  lunch today too - even if I do have to clear beer bottles off the deck.




Congratulations to the graduating class of 2012. We hope you had fun.




**One more thing..**




One last reason to celebrate is that as of today, **I am employable in the USA**.  I can now contribute fiscally again to the household income. The card from the US arrived today so now I can work in the USA and [make more money for more shoes](http://jim.am/does-your-wife-have-too-many-shoes/). It’s been a long five months waiting for this day to come and we’re happy.




Oh. Right…. married 3 months today. Life is Good. ?
