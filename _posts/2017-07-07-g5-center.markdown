I always wanted to own one of these Macs and never got the chance when they were current. But now they are a[ lot cheaper](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2380057.m570.l1313.TR12.TRC2.A0.H0.Xpowermac+g5.TRS0&_nkw=powermac+g5&_sacat=0) and this site has lots of resource how to make the best out of Appleâ€™s PowerPC desktop for Pros
