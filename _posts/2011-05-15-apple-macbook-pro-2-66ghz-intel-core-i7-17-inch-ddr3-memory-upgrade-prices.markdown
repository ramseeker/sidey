The Apple MacBook Pro 2.66, while now in 2011 is a discontinued Apple computer model, it’s still a bargain to [upgrade the RAM ](http://www.jim.am)on this powerful notebook from  Apple with a 2.66GHz Intel Core i7 and I’m not the only one that thinks this, as this particular memory upgrade is one of the best selling ram upgrades you can buy today.




**RAM Specifications for Apple MacBook Pro 2.66**




The Apple MacBook Pro 2.66 17 inch notebook shipped from Apple  with just 4GB of RAM installed at the factory, but you can easily double the RAM on this notebook computer by buying 2x4GB memory modules, or  if you prefer an 8GB  memory upgrade kit  for MacBook Pro to max out the memory on this specific MacBook Pro Model using the two upgrade slots available in the MacBook Pro. You do have to replace the factory installed 2x2GB ram modules with the larger 4GB memory upgrades as there’s very little room inside a MacBook Pro  as apposed to a desktop system that allows for more ram capacity and memory configuration choices.




**How to Install MacBook Pro 2.66 GHz Intel Core i7 RAM **




It’s really easy to install the memory yourself on the MacBook Pro 2.66Ghz and if you buy quality ram and take your time on the ram install and guard against static electricity the result will be a faster MacBook Pro than before, which is one of the reasons for a memory upgrade in the first place.




Apple will even provide you with [handy instructions](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1270) on how to perform the upgrade of your MacBook Pro 2.66Ghz step by step and althogh this may not apply anymore, depending on whether you bought AppleCare for your 2010 MacBook Pro will not void your warranty either.




It’s really a  simple  upgrade and memory prices haven’t been cheaper ever, so now’s the time to **[max out the ram on your MacBook Pro 2.66 Ghz ](http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1548159-10273954?url=http://www.crucial.com/store/affiliateredirect.asp?imodule=CT2KIT51264BC1067&aid=1027395&cid=777292&subid=89&PRS&uscj&cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1067)**to 8GB and enjoy a faster and smoother running MacBook Pro 2.66Ghz as a result.
