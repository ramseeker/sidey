The Cheapest RAM for Apple iMacs can be found here for [4GB DDR3 1333MHz sodimms](http://www.jim.am/memory/iMac_(DDR3_1333)/), which is the type of RAM you will need for the 2010 Apple iMacs. The Apple iMacs released in the summer of 2010 can accept up to [16GB of RAM](http://www.jim.am/memory/iMac_KITS_(DDR3_1333)/) and by filling the four available memory upgrade slots with 4x4GB DDR sodimms for Apple iMac you will enjoy faster iMac, and an Apple desktop computer that will be able to open more applications at the same time too – allowing you to get more done faster




There’s rumor of a 2011 iMac in April, and it wouldn’t surprise me, as the iMac is Apple’s consumer based desktop computer and the release of the new Apple iMacs would be in time for both the back to school shopping season as well as the Christmas shopping season for for 2011.

    **Where to find the Cheapest 2010 iMac RAM   **   I've already mentioned the type of RAM you need to buy to fill your Apple iMac with memory, and the next question is where to buy RAM for iMac for less? I'm a fan of, [Crucial](http://amzn.to/2oA2gjC), [OWC](http://www.jim.am/OWC) and [1-800-4-Memory ](http://www.jim.am/1800)to name a few of the best memory stores, with OWC being the only online store dedicated entirely to apple upgrades, they might be your best bet if you need advice on what specific RAM you need to buy for the latest iMacs, but the other memory stores should be able to help you out too as they not only carry memory for Apple, but also other PC manufacturers such as Dell, Sony, HP etc.
      
    
    
      
      
    
    
    One other factor to determine when shopping for the cheapest iMac memory you can buy is support, after or before you buy. Of the few memory stores I listed above, just one actually offers name brand and in most cases is not the cheapest RAM as the Crucial memory is name brand RAM made by Micron, whereas for the most part, all the other stores offer two types of RAM for iMacs, both name brand and generic but the generic stuff is what gets quoted when shopping for Apple iMac RAM and the lowest price is the most important buying decision.
      
    
    
      
      
    
    
    Whatever way you choose to go, whether that means buying RAM from Amazon or Best Buy, or you select the few memory stores I recommend you will do much, much, better on price for 2010 iMac memory if you stay away from the Apple Store. Apple's stores are great when you physcially need to see or touch the Apple product before you buy it, but for memory products this is really not needed, and there's a very good chance Apple will supply you with Micron or Samsung memory upgrades anyway, so you're better to shop online for iMac RAM for considerable savings.
