# Friday




Well, she did it.




BW managed to get my sorry rear end off the couch, into the Honda and on our way for week without students or silverados to think about and now that  we have arrived, I must say we are having a **very good time. **




## Are We There Yet?




Friday morning we were on the road at 8am and started the loooong drive to Alabama. It was only a few hours into it when we decided that stopping for a break might be a good idea, so dear readers I present to you pee stop number 1:

This is where BW got to pet a dog and I was able to stretch my legs for a bit and then back on the road we were with the final destination of the day  being [Bowling Green Kentucky ](https://www.visitbgky.com/)for a night at the[ Hampton Inn. ](http://hamptoninn3.hilton.com/en/index.html)




But between us and the inn was  lot of driving ahead of us so we just drove and drove and enjoyed the many sights that the great american road trip has to offer us :

and then we finally arrived in Louisville and had some excellent Mexican Food at [El Taco Luchador](http://www.el-taco-luchador.com/) which we would have never have found if it was not for  [Yelp](http://yelp.com).  That app along with [Google Maps](http://google.com/maps) has pretty much saved our bacon this trip.

After dinner, we hopped back in the car, booked into the hotel and collapsed.
