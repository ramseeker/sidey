*last updated: April 6, 2020*

There was once a time when I was all about technology and I [even compared ram prices](https://ramseeker.com) for a living, but those days are over and now I write about pretty much anything I want here and that's **so much more fun** than tweaking the price drops on memory. You think math is boring? Try that.

So, priorities have changed.

I now have a lot more to write about and live for. I have a [beautiful daughter](https://jim.am/shes-here/)

and a beautiful wife and that's something I would never have thought would happen to me


I'm living the dream! And somewhere along the way  - and I am **not sure how** I managed to write over 800 posts and 320,000 words. Which well, is crazy as I never did really consider myself as a writer but you know..maybe I am.

This site isn't for pageviews. I do track them via [google analytics](http://analytics.google.com) as it's kind of fun to see who and where my visitors come frome. I'll save you the suspense - not many. :)

But that's okay. This site is a hodge-podge of posts from a few sites all together from personal stuff like writing about her [favorite pacifier](https://jim.am/donald/) to articles about is it worth it to [upgrade your ram](https://jim.am/a-decade-of-soldered-ram/) so it's no wonder that I don't get many visitors from search engines, but whatever. This is a hobby site now first and foremost.  Heck, if I could break even to pay for the domain renewal I would be happy. :)


What I do want to track is how many words I write here because I think it would be fun to see if I could get to a [million words written](https://jim.am/one-million-words/) on this site. You know - throw some mud on the wall and see what sticks when it does come to search traffic, and might help me answer more questions that I have about writing and whether I can stick with it/make a living and more.

One thought I had was to write about all the stuff she has but frankly, by the time I get her to bed and **pick up all the toys** who wants to then have to sit down and write about them?

So, that's out. Besides, it's too spammy as all I would do would be grab an image from Amazon, write a small blurb and then post a link hoping that I would get a small commission. There's no value to either of us in a post like this. Here's an example: I bought this [amazon fire tablet case](https://jim.am/fire-tablet-kids-case/) so she would not drop the tablet and smash it into a million pieces. The MSRP on the tablet is just $50.00 but still, I thought that the  ten bucks I paid for it was a pretty good deal and it works just fine. Just, I don't want to write about it and you don't want to read it.

This leaves me with explaining about what this site is about, and I guess you could say...me. It's what I want it to be. I might rant about how the [old egg carton](https://jim.am/egg-carton/) is now her favorite or I might write about how the [coronavirus](https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20200310/know-the-symptoms-of-covid19) just sucks. period.

Or, I might just write. At this point, I think the topic is secondary.
