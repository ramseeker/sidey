Under ‘normal’ circumstances you can usually find somewhere that will send or receive a fax for you locally and I guess if you fax a lot then the land/fax line thing isn’t a big deal, but for us deplorables that use mobile phones as their only communication device we’re sunk.The best thing would be to get rid of the fax altogether and then you wouldn’t have to worry. Apple’s phones can lock you out so it’s worthless, so the privacy technology is available or at least doable. I guess the trick is how? Heck, I can rent a server that’s HIPAA safe for a few bucks. It must be possible to do better than having to rely on faxes in 2020Maybe this is like trying to ‘build a better mouse trap’.

Our current mower has been going great for sometime, but - it’s time. I have replaced more than one power switch on the thing and there comes a point where you don’t want to spend any more on a old electric mower.So new mower. Exciting.Actually, it is kind of exciting. This will be the 3rd mower I will have had in the past 8 years:The first one came with the house! I don’t think it’s ever a good idea for a mower to be included with the house as chances are the thing isn’t worth moving and with this one, I think this was the case. It met it’s death due to the fact the steering broke and I ran into a fence with it.My current mower is a cheapo electric job I have had for about 5 years so for the price I paid it has served us well. The breakdown for this one seems to be wheels that wobble, and the safety switch that turns off the mower stopped working last fall and that’s the nail in the coffin for it. It could be fixed for about $40, but then there’s still the wheels, and dull blade and it’s corded.I don’t really mind using a corded mower. The trick is to mow away fromt the outlet. Once you have that figured out you are golden.The new mower seems…fine. It’s battery powered so might be a little quieter which would be nice as I like to listen to podcasts while I am sweltering under the summer sun. The battery seems to be most of the cost as the rest of it looks like what you pay for - lots of plastic. But at $300, it’s stil a lot cheaper than a riding mower which we don’t need and a lot cheaper than than having someone come and mow the lawn once a week so there’s that.I also get a bit of exercise with this push mower so that’s always a good thing - especially this spring with the COVID lockdown where it seems that if I walk across the room it’s considered ‘exercise’ by my fitness app. I know I pushed my old mower around today and I’m feeling it. I hope this new mower isn’t all that heavy.If I never had to mow a lawn again I would be good with that, and the time will eventually come for that but for now there’s worse things to do than get a bit of exercise mowing the lawn?",

Great, right?</p><p>The homemade face masks show up and they look fine and considering they were free and we don’t go anywhere anyway I thought that these would be just fine. They fit.

Ever since I finally realized that this site is for me and for fun more than finance I actually write.One would think that this would mean more site visitors over time and that I would wan to count that, but meh. I will count words written rather than visitors as lately it has much more value to me.Lastly, with no cookies on this site I don’t have put one of those we use cookies warnings on this site. If there’s no trackers and no cookies there’s nothing to warn you about.And I found that if I track the pages you visit I find that I “chase the dragon” and only write about more stuff that’s popular instead of writing about other topics and exploring more stuff to write about.And that’s no fun.",

It is what it is and we are doing the best we can to cope and nobody in the house is extremely sick which is very good newsAlso, we have toilet paper.
