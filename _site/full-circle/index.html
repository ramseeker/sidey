Such is the case with ramseeker.</p> <p>When I started ramseeker the site was hosted on my old domain - <a href="http://www.macseek.com">macseek.com</a> - as this was really just a personal blog or hobby site to <strong>write about whatever I wanted</strong> and in the early days I was known as <strong>‘ramseeker on macseek.com’</strong> - quite the mouthful.</p> <p>So…..back in the days of $35.00 domain name registration, I coughed up the dough to buy jim.am as my domain name as more and more were coming for the ram prices and less and less were coming for my content.</p> <p>Over time I started to list and track memory prices from over 30 vendors and back in the late 90’s and early 00’s buying ram for the Mac was a good deal as it allowed you to upgrade the computer to it’s fastest and most useful capacity for not much money compared to how much you spent for the Mac you bought that was usually (and still is) priced well over $1000.</p> <p>Over time, more and more people came for the ram prices and less and less for my writing and with more readers, came more and more advertisers, allowing me to quit my job and concentrate on jim.am full time.</p> <h2>I Blame the MacBook Air and iOS</h2> <p>Then Apple computers started to be released with no-replaceable ram upgrades. First, the MacBook Air, and now in 2016, save for a few desktop models <strong>you can’t upgrade the ram in any new Mac you can buy today.</strong></p> <p>This is good news and bad. Good, because Apple has optimized Mac OS so well that for most users you don’t really need to upgrade the ram anyway because most Macs ship with enough ram for the everyday user. For most of us, you don’t even have to think of adding more ram.</p> <p>Bad, because well….you can’t upgrade the ram on your new Mac and because you don’t need to shop for memory prices for ram you can’t use due to the fact your new Mac is locked in as snug as a bug in a rug.</p> <p>This, as you can imagine has resulted in a drop in site traffic and earnings over the years. So much so, that I had to go and get a job again after a few years of relying on this site for my one and only source of income.</p> <p>I’m actually okay with a job again for the most part, and I have come to terms that tracking ram prices is no longer a service that’s really needed.</p> <p>Just like video killed the radio star, the iPhone and iPad killed the Mac, and as you’re well aware all iOS devices cannot take a ram upgrade.</p> <p>If you do want to buy ram today for some older Mac or PC, there are so many vendors and the prices are all the same. At time of writing, <a href="http://amzn.to/2cnzaPL">8GB memory upgrade kits</a> are about $30.00 and <a href="http://amzn.to/2d4s1qz">16GB kits are about twice that</a>. (makes sense, no?)</p> <p>RAM is cheap, and most vendors are within a dollar or two depending on whether you buy generic or brand memory. It’s not like it once was when ram prices were hundreds of dollars and taking the time to research ram prices was worth the effort as it allowed you to save money.</p> <h2>So Now What?</h2> <p>I’m going to write about what interests me.</p> <p>I’ve been link blogging a bit lately, as it’s quick enough to do and it’s a great way to be able to retrieve the sites or apps or articles I want to remember as all I have to do is <a href="http://jim.am/archives">search the archives</a> to find the link or article again.</p> <p>ramseeker needs to be fun again for me, and tracking memory prices for older macs where the demand is less and less over time isn’t really the best idea to continue with.</p> <p>In the past, ramseeker was all about apple memory and I still have a small guide to help you <a href="http://jim.am/models">get the right memory</a> for your Mac but I won’t be trying to compete with Apple news sites as there a lot better sites than mine for that.</p> <p>I hope to write more ‘think pieces’ as some of the blogs I follow currently- they have a voice - and although they don’t post daily they do have something to say and over time I think I might have an opinion or story or two to share as well</p> <p>Lately, I have been very interested in writing and all the tools that can be used to get words online so I might like to investigate that further and start writing and reviewing apps that allow me to get my thoughts online. I am currently writing this article in markdown with <a href="http://www.marxi.co">marxico</a> as it syncs with evernote and just overall works for me quite well. But there are many other tools out there and I want to explore and share my findings here.</p> <p>I’m also going to start linking to other sites I like. I think that in 2016, this is a very old-fashioned thing to do thanks to social media but I guess I’m old-school and just want to share an article or entire site and this will be the place where this gets done.</p> <p>I guess if I had to summarize, it would be that I no longer am making ram prices my priority (that said, I do have a <a href="http://www.jim.am/models">handy list</a> to help you find the right ram for you mac) and I’m changing the direction of the site.</p> <p>I’m not sure what direction that will be yet - but that’s half the fun. ?</p> <span class="meta"><time datetime="2016-09-18T20:00:00-04:00">September 18, 2016</time> &middot; </span> <!--<span class="meta"><time datetime="2016-09-18T20:00:00-04:00">September 18, 2016</time> &middot; </span> --> </section> </main> </body> </html>
