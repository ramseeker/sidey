We had wanted to go get some soul food at this little hole in the wall, but it was closed, but  we did find <a href="http://www.farmburger.net/huntsville-al/">farmburger</a> which was really good. As usual, I just had a plain old burger and fries but BW had a burger with all the fixings:</p> <p><img src="https://jim.am/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_20170603_121249450.jpg" alt="IMG_20170603_121249450.jpg" /></p> <p>and then once we had our burgers off to the space center we went. But before I share our adventures at the space center  I need to tell a quick story about BW losing stuff.</p> <p>When we pulled into the parking lot of the space center we decided that BW would be the one to carry wallets/keys/etc so she went to get her laptop bag and use it as a shoulder bag.</p> <p>Lo and behold, what did she find?</p> <p><img src="https://jim.am/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_20170603_125606901_HDR.jpg" alt="IMG_20170603_125606901_HDR.jpg" /></p> <p>You see, last January just after BW went on the hook for 2 years for a brand new <a href="http://apple.com/iphone">iPhone 7</a> she called me in a panic at the airport while she was coming home from a conference in Denver.</p> <p>“Jimmy, somebody stole my iphone!”</p> <p>I went online and tracked it and we thought it was gone because the tracking showed it went from the airport to some seedy airport bar across the street. I wiped it remotely and we both realized that it was probably gone for good.</p> <p>As luck would have it, I had her mothers’ older phone on my desk as I was supposed to sell it on eBay and didn’t get around to it yet so I just went to the Verizon store  and had them de-activate the lost model and activate the new one where I met BW at the airport with her brand new old iPhone.</p> <p>Then. As you can already guess by the photo.. guess what BW found in her bag? Her  thought-to-be stolen iPhone 7! Woo Hoo. (I still have questions about how the phone showed it was at a bar across the street, but whatever.)</p> <p>This bag I tell you is **magic. **Last week, BW called me in a panic (notice a theme here?) that when she got to the border to go to Canada and she could not find her nexus card.</p> <p>Guess what she found the other day in this bag? Yup, the nexus card.</p> <p>The problem with this bag is that there are <strong>too many pockets</strong> and BW (obviously by now) keeps on losing stuff in them.</p> <p>Anyway. Crisis (s) averted. We have her iPhone 7. It’s all good.  At least now we are making payments on a phone we still possess now.</p> <p>Onward and upwards to</p> <h2>Space Photos!</h2> <p>The space center was actually nicer and more fun than I expected. Lots of interesting stuff to look at and learn about..</p> <p>after we walked on the moon’s surface and avoided the gift shop attractions (actually, BW bought a mug) and saw what we could see at the center we then drove the remainder of the way to Mobile Alabama.</p> <p>And finally, we had arrived here in Mobile.</p> <p><img src="https://jim.am/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_20170604_103323220_HDR-EFFECTS.jpg" alt="IMG_20170604_103323220_HDR-EFFECTS.jpg" /></p> <p>until next time..</p> <span class="meta"><time datetime="2017-06-07T02:36:33+00:00">June 7, 2017</time> &middot; </span> <!--<span class="meta"><time datetime="2017-06-07T02:36:33+00:00">June 7, 2017</time> &middot; </span> --> </section> </main> </body> </html>
