(kidding! He was the judge)</p> <ol start="2"> <li></li> </ol> <p>This was the first time I have worn a tie in over a year</p> <p>Also, I was given an naturalization certificate. I have proof. I didn’t just make this up.</p> <p>BW could not make it to the event today due to work, so my MIL drove across the state of New York to watch yours truly take his oath because - well, I’m family now (and have been for a while) .</p> <p>It was a very, very nice venue for such an event as it was held at the <a href="https://www.trsite.org/">Theodore Roosevelt Inauguration Site</a> which is not the norm so not only was it a special event but it was at a special venue too - just one day past President’s day (and family day back in the old country)</p> <p>Today 31 people like myself became US citizens from 18 countries.</p> <p>There was a play about the inauguration, as well as a barbershop quartet that sang the national anthem. This was not what was expected. The judge was very nice and even allowed us for a re-shoot so we could get a few more pictures after the ceremony.</p> <p>The form said no mobile phones so we left them in the car, but lots and lots had phones and I think that I would have more photos rather than have to show how to use a camera. But we got a few good ones and they are all the same save for one of me at the stage to collect my certificate.</p> <p>I have to tell you that I was getting a little nervous and thought I was forgotten about because it seemed like they called everybody but me but the worry was all for naught because I was called up and handed the certificate.</p> <p>I have to share that it was kind of scary handing over my green card for the last time as it took me so much to move here and get it and then give it away. The USCIS representative joked about this when she was talking about what to do when you get the certificate, etc so it seems this is a common thing and I’m not the only neurotic one. ?</p> <p>This was a team effort. I might have been the one with certificate in my hand but I would not be here without the Support of both BW’s and my families and friends that helped in so many different ways. Also, I would like to thank the Academy…..</p> <p>Of course, this would not be a blog post without some mention of pie, but I hate to disappoint. Considering that the last time I got handed a certificate of any kind was over 25 years ago you would think that pie would be on the menu right?</p> <p>Wellllll….no.</p> <p>We did go out for a nice dinner at <a href="http://www.dickandjennysny.com/">Dick and Jenny’s </a>and then we split some cheesecake.</p> <p><img src="http://jim.am/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/null-17.jpeg" alt="" /></p> <p>So it’s **kind of ** like pie. Regardless it was still delicious.</p> <p>Lastly, the best part is that I am **done **with the immigration system. No more forms to fill. No more fingerprinting.</p> <p>I remember when BW and I were still dating and we talked about how it would take about five years or more to get here and it seemed soooo long and far away - if not impossible to actually get to the citizenship step, but here I am.</p> <p>And I have to tell you I kind of like my new home. ?</p> <p>Best,</p> <p>TH and Co.</p> <span class="meta"><time datetime="2018-02-21T02:51:57+00:00">February 21, 2018</time> &middot; </span> <!--<span class="meta"><time datetime="2018-02-21T02:51:57+00:00">February 21, 2018</time> &middot; </span> --> </section> </main> </body> </html>
