You think math is boring? Try that.</p> <p>So, priorities have changed.</p> <p>I now have a lot more to write about and live for. I have a <a href="https://jim.am/shes-here/">beautiful daughter</a></p> <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/M2qsW6E.jpg" alt="" /></p> <p>and a beautiful wife and that’s something I would never have thought would happen to me</p> <p>I’m living the dream! And somewhere along the way - and I am <strong>not sure how</strong> I managed to write over 800 posts and 320,000 words. Which well, is crazy as I never did really consider myself as a writer but you know..maybe I am.</p> <p>This site isn’t for pageviews. I do track them via <a href="http://analytics.google.com">google analytics</a> as it’s kind of fun to see who and where my visitors come frome. I’ll save you the suspense - not many. :)</p> <p>But that’s okay. This site is a hodge-podge of posts from a few sites all together from personal stuff like writing about her <a href="https://jim.am/donald/">favorite pacifier</a> to articles about is it worth it to <a href="https://jim.am/a-decade-of-soldered-ram/">upgrade your ram</a> so it’s no wonder that I don’t get many visitors from search engines, but whatever. This is a hobby site now first and foremost. Heck, if I could break even to pay for the domain renewal I would be happy. :)</p> <p>What I do want to track is how many words I write here because I think it would be fun to see if I could get to a <a href="https://jim.am/one-million-words/">million words written</a> on this site. You know - throw some mud on the wall and see what sticks when it does come to search traffic, and might help me answer more questions that I have about writing and whether I can stick with it/make a living and more.</p> <p>One thought I had was to write about all the stuff she has but frankly, by the time I get her to bed and <strong>pick up all the toys</strong> who wants to then have to sit down and write about them?</p> <p>So, that’s out. Besides, it’s too spammy as all I would do would be grab an image from Amazon, write a small blurb and then post a link hoping that I would get a small commission. There’s no value to either of us in a post like this. Here’s an example: I bought this <a href="https://jim.am/fire-tablet-kids-case/">amazon fire tablet case</a> so she would not drop the tablet and smash it into a million pieces. The MSRP on the tablet is just $50.00 but still, I thought that the ten bucks I paid for it was a pretty good deal and it works just fine. Just, I don’t want to write about it and you don’t want to read it.</p> <p>This leaves me with explaining about what this site is about, and I guess you could say…me. It’s what I want it to be. I might rant about how the <a href="https://jim.am/egg-carton/">old egg carton</a> is now her favorite or I might write about how the <a href="https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20200310/know-the-symptoms-of-covid19">coronavirus</a> just sucks. period.</p> <p>Or, I might just write. At this point, I think the topic is secondary.</p> <p><strong>Amazon Disclaimer</strong></p> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <p><strong>Privacy Statement</strong></p> <p>I do not share personal information with third-parties nor do I store information I collect about your visit to this blog for use other than to analyze content performance through the use of cookies, which you can turn off at any time by modifying your Internet browser’s settings.</p> <p>I am not responsible for the republishing of the content found on my blog on other Web sites or media without my permission.
