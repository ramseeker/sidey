To be honest, I wasn’t expecting much but the food and service were both fantastic at the Cheesecake Factory.  We had a really great time, until…</p> <p>**“You Don’t Want That” **</p> <p><strong><strong>Finally, the time comes around for dessert - and of course, <strong>cheesecake</strong>! I mean the meal was just so you could get to the dessert at a dining establishment such as this - we didn’t  go to the salad factory (although by the menu items, you could argue differently)  or the burger factory -</strong> we were there for the cheesecake!</strong></p> <p>As you can imagine, the cheesecake selection was as long as my arm but   I only was interested in one flavor: <strong>cherry</strong>. And as soon as I announce I’ll have cherry cheesecake. B pipes up and simply states:</p> <p>” You don’t want that”.</p> <p>” I don’t” I ask?</p> <p>” No, Cherry is gross -  why don’t you get the red velvet cheesecake? It sounds delicious!!”.</p> <p>“Umm, because I.. <strong>want cherry</strong>?!!”</p> <p>So the plan with the cheesecake I am learning (in real time, I might add)  was I was supposed to order the chocolate macadamia nut, or red velvet or <strong>anything but cherry,</strong> so I could share with my beautiful wife…</p> <p>And I don’t know..maybe it was the euphoria of the cherry cheesecake anticipation or the overwhelming of my senses drying to decipher a 325 item menu, but I bravely said “<strong>no, I still want the cherry</strong>”.</p> <p>Then of course what went from a simple choice and  announcement about my dessert selection is now, for lack of a better word - a ‘thing’. Now we have to discuss this: Am I to forgo my cherry so we can share and select one of her choices now that I am aware of what the cheesecake plan really is? or do I stand my ground and say “No! No sharing! We’re talking cheesecake here! Every man and woman for themselves!! “ ?</p> <p>it seemed like hours went by as we <!-- raw HTML omitted -->entertained<!-- raw HTML omitted --> annoyed our friends across the table with our cheesecake showdown. At one point, I think we were arm wrestling…</p> <p>The verdict: We shared the cherry, and B loved it too . Cherry Cheesecake is just one of  the many many things that’s just better with two, and it tastes much, much better than eggplant. ?</p> <p> </p> <span class="meta"><time datetime="2012-06-18T17:45:00-04:00">June 18, 2012</time> &middot; </span> <!--<span class="meta"><time datetime="2012-06-18T17:45:00-04:00">June 18, 2012</time> &middot; </span> --> </section> </main> </body> </html>
