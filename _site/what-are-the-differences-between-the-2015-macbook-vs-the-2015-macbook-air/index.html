The Air offers 2 USB 3.0 ports, a thunderbolt port, a magsafe power port and a 1/8 headphone jack.</p> <p>The 11 inch model offers minimal ports too compared to the 13 inch Apple notebooks but it still offer many more ports than the 12 inch MacBook does.</p> <h2>Display</h2> <p>The better display is on the 12 inch MacBook as the display on the rMB is a 2304-by-1440 IPS display with 226 pixels per inch and is a 16:10 ratio.</p> <p>The 11 inch MacBook Air is the older TN panel display that’s pretty old and has been standard fare on the Apple portables for some time until the release of retina displays for the MacBook Pro models were released.</p> <p>The 11 inch MacBook Air offers a 16:9 display ratio for a 1366 x 768px resolution as the native option</p> <h2>Processor</h2> <p>I have already mentioned the speeds of the different models but the MacBook Air is actually the faster of the two models for more CPU intensive stuff but if you need the light weight of the MacBook then you might be okay with the slower MacBook.</p> <h2>Weight</h2> <p>The 12 inch MacBook wins here but not by all that much:</p> <p>The MacBook Air weighs 2.38lbs while the MacBook comes in at just over 2lbs at 2.03lbs.</p> <p>Personally, I bet there’s very little difference in weight for everyday travel. I guess if you absolutely need the lightest notebook possible the MacBook wins, but I wouldn’t really let about a 1/4 lb be the deciding factor</p> <h2>Color</h2> <p>Here’s another thing I wouldn’t care for but some might. The MaBook is available in three colors: Gold, Space Grey and Silver whereas the MacBook Air is still silver, same as it always was.</p> <h2>Keyboard and Trackpad</h2> <p>The keyboard and trackpad technology is completely different between the two models. The MacBook offers a newly designed ‘butterfly’ keyboard design with a shallower travel vs the standard scissor design of the MacBook Air.</p> <p>The trackpad is also all new on the MacBook with a <strong>force touch</strong> keyboard standard on Apple’s latest technology, while the MacBook Air still offers the standard multi-gesture glass trackpad we have all come to love</p> <h2>Battery Life</h2> <p>Apple claims that the Battery on the MacBook lasts up to 10 hours and the MacBook Air offers 9 hours. Of course, both of these estimates are under the best operating conditions so your mileage will vary but I don’t see battery life being a real big problem for both computers as they both offer close to entire day of battery life.</p> <h2>Summary</h2> <p>It’s a hard decision to choose between the 12 inch MacBook vs the 11 inch MacBook Air. The MacBook offers weight and battery life advantages along with some new hardware tech, while the 11 inch MacBook air for 2005 is really just a refresh of the same old design.</p> <p>The display might be the big difference between the two that decides what MacBook to buy but personally, and for my needs – writing and very light image editing I think if I were to buy a new Apple notebook today I would buy the 11 inch MacBook Air.</p> <p>Also, I don’t think the display on the 11 inch MacBook Air is all that bad either.</p> <p>The MacBook looks like fun but at $1300 for the base model and the lack of ports that force you to buy adapters to connect peripherals make me want to hold off on this model until I see MacBook 2.0 in 2016.</p> <span class="meta"><time datetime="2015-06-10T20:00:00-04:00">June 10, 2015</time> &middot; </span> <!--<span class="meta"><time datetime="2015-06-10T20:00:00-04:00">June 10, 2015</time> &middot; </span> --> </section> </main> </body> </html>
