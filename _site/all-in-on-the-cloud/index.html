<p>I have been a little obsessive lately about backups. Specifically, my photos like the one you see above of my little one as I do not <a href="https://jim.am/backup-your-photos/">want to lose them</a> due to some cloud failure.</p>
<p>I had thought about storing them locally, but I really don’t have the time to fiddle with hard drives and backup software and RAID settgings so all the hard drives will go on eBay and I will go <strong>all in on the cloud</strong>  as there are apps for every cloud server that will <strong>backup my photos automatically.</strong></p>
<p>I’ve gone a little overboard as I have my photos backed up on <a href="http://photos.google.com">Google Photos</a>, <a href="http://drive.google.com">Google Drive</a>, <a href="http://photos.amazon.com">Amazon Photos</a>, <a href="http://mega.nz">MEGA</a>, <a href="http://onedrive.com">OneDrive</a> and <a href="http://pcloud.com">pCloud</a> and <a href="http://icedrive.net">IceDrive</a>. I defintely don’t need all these but except for pCloud and Google Drive all the others are free when it comes to storage. I had tried <a href="http://deego.com">Deego</a> but it  looks to spammy for my liking with ads and app downloads all over.</p>
<p>I had thought about setting up a NAS using a raspberry pi or <a href="https://amzn.to/2SALgsv">even just buying one</a>, but I don’t have time or inclination to do that any more.</p>
<p>I’ve also realized that I really don’t need my camera gear I have as my <strong>phone is good enough.</strong> In fact I have yet to take a photo of my daughter with anything but my phone as they are that good in 2019.</p>
<p>In 2037 when she’s 18 and I have thousands and thousands of photos I want to be sure I can get to them all and the cloud seems to be the easiest and safest way.</p>
<p>I guess we will see.</p>
