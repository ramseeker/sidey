A few people called and  wanted to pick it up later in the week - some even offering me bribes to hold the thing, but I wanted to get this task behind  me so I could go back to sitting in my comfy chair so no holds.  I also learned that even when the thing is FREE you can’t even give it away. One woman called, said she was leaving in the afternoon from over an hour away, and I told her I would not hold the thing for her, but afterwards thought I would be a swell guy and hold it for her and of course, she did not show.</p> <p>After dinner, another woman called about it and I said yes, the dog kennel is still here and still free, and  she said she’d be here in 20 minutes or so. In the meantime, the phone kept ringing and I could  have given away a dozen or more dog kennels if we had them.  We had thought we had yet another no-show on her hands but nope, about 8pm a van pulls up and out pops 2 adults and 3 kids and they started to dismantle the dog kennel only to find there’s no way that fence is going into that passenger van.</p> <p>So calls were made and as I write this the fence is leaning against the side of the house awaiting pickup from friend with truck. We’d like to see it gone today and I have no reason to think it won’t be. And if not, I have  a long list of others willing to pick up the kennel</p> <p>**One Task Done, Another Begins **</p> <p>Welcome to married life. Now that we’ve got the dog kennel out of here, my next task is weed and remove the concrete tiles (heavy!) where the kennel stood and then the question begs: what to do with this space? I suggested sand box, but got laughed at - but we may  try our  hands at a small herb/vegetable garden..Tomatoes, carrots…etc. I’ve never been a big fan of gardening but B would love it and all it takes is a pile of dirt and some seeds. I could get really fancy and create a border around it, but I may be getting ahead of myself…</p> <p><strong>Craigslist Lessons Learned</strong></p> <p>“I’ll be there” means nothing.</p> <p>If you give it away, somebody will need it or use it.</p> <p>People are nice. Every person I spoke to was nice. I’m usually reluctant to deal with craigslist due to the fact that you never know what you’re going to get, but this was a relatively painless and quick process.</p> <p><strong>A Clean House</strong></p> <p>Due to the nice weather we had, we also got lots of other stuff done around  the house. I cut the lawn and painted in the kitchen and fixed a table (I hope) with some wood glue and B buzzed around running the diswasher, four loads of laundry and other puttering around the house.  We hadn’t really planned it but  we managed to get a lot done around the house but still managed to sit outside for a while. The summertime evening light is just priceless.</p> <p> </p> <span class="meta"><time datetime="2012-05-20T08:34:00+00:00">May 20, 2012</time> &middot; </span> <!--<span class="meta"><time datetime="2012-05-20T08:34:00+00:00">May 20, 2012</time> &middot; </span> --> </section> </main> </body> </html>
