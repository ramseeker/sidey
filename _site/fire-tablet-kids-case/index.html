<p>This is one of the late addtitions to the <strong>pile of stuff</strong> that comes into the house when you have kids. I found this on <a href="http:/mercari.com">Mercari</a> for a lot less than you can buy it on <a href="https://amzn.to/2QHiNBx">Amazon</a>  as  I find that the cases  for <a href="https://amzn.to/2UeRuAE">Amazon’s fire tablets </a>  are kind of pricey.</p>
<p>Consider this - the <a href="https://amzn.to/2WH3RXC">tablet I bought this case for</a> sells for $49.00 and yet Amazon wants just under $30 for this case.  I know kids are rough on tablets but spending that much on a case that doesn’t cost much less than a tablet.</p>
<p>Anyway. Now I can hand it to her and there’s a good chance the tablet will survive the day.</p>
