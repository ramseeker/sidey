( I wonder if she really means it?)</p> <p>So, I promised that the four days I had off I would ‘fix’ the shed.</p> <p>The plan was to shingle and paint the shed you see above and despite the fact that I did not have any experience with shingles ( I have<a href="http://jim.am/2017/07/03/are-you-ever-going-to-blog-again/"> lots of painting experience</a>) and a fear of heights there was no way that I would be able to escape this to-do list on the fridge. It was happening.</p> <p>We went to Lowes where we were all ready to buy paint and supplies but then as we were walking into the store we saw this:</p> <p><img src="http://jim.am/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_20170702_145535552.jpg.jpeg" alt="IMG_20170702_145535552.jpg" /></p> <p>Consider that:</p> <ul> <li></li> </ul> <p>I have never shingled before</p> <ul> <li></li> </ul> <p>I am not real good with power tools</p> <ul> <li></li> </ul> <p>I like easy</p> <p>I managed to convince bw that it would be just as easy to just get rid of the old shed rather than spend the money to fix the old one as the price difference between shingles and paint and all the extras that always seemed to be needed and price-wise this isn’t really all that more expensive.</p> <p>Also, the shed was on sale too.</p> <p>So, I like easy. BW likes me, and we’re getting a new shed. Seems good, right?</p> <p>Then when home I came to the realization that I would have to get rid of the shed.</p> <p>Turns out that this is more complicated than I thought. I would need a ladder, some power tools, a dumpster for the driveway to take it away, and god knows what else. <strong>What have I done?</strong></p> <p>The next morning I emptied out the old shed of all the crap we had in it and most of it went to the garbage bin. You would be surprised what you don’t need.</p> <p><img src="http://jim.am/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_20170704_114809593.jpg.jpeg" alt="IMG_20170704_114809593.jpg" /></p> <p>We kept BW’s old bike, the lawnmower and the wheelbarrow and the tools and shovels. The shovels and stuff found a new home in the garage with a hanger that was in the old shed that was not getting used. So I re-painted the hanger with some krylon and ta-da! We now have organized shovels and stuff.</p> <p><img src="http://jim.am/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_20170705_170133960.jpg.jpeg" alt="IMG_20170705_170133960.jpg" /></p> <p>Back to the shed:</p> <p>Shed is empty - check</p> <p>Shed needs to go - check</p> <p>New shed ordered - check</p> <p>Now all I had to do was to figure out how I was going to get rid of it without injury?</p> <p>I know, I thought: I will give it away!</p> <p>Enter <a href="https://www.craigslist.org/">craigslist</a>. I posted an ad and some photos that stated:</p> <p>Free shed.</p> <p>You must dismantle and take away.</p> <p>Shed is in good shape, but needs shingles and paint</p> <p>Contents not included</p> <p>Then ten minutes later the phone rang. Somebody wanted the shed, and they were on the way to pick it up.</p> <p>**BW now thinks I am a genius. **</p> <p>Sure enough, about a half an hour later a young guy shows up with a trailer and his girlfriend, and starts to dismantle the shed. I offered to help but he didn’t want to have anything to do with it - so fine - BW and I drank cold drinks on the deck while the shed got dismantled, and not by me. ?</p> <p>It took the poor fellow all day to get the roof off (admittedly the trickiest part) but he did and then the next day he came right back and got the walls and other bits and off he went. He’s happy he has a shed for a workshop and I’m happy that I have no shed and a happy wife.</p> <p><img src="http://jim.am/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_20170704_204552783_HDR.jpg.jpeg" alt="IMG_20170704_204552783_HDR.jpg" /></p> <p>The dog watched our shed drive off into the sunset.</p> <p><img src="http://jim.am/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_20170704_202610223.jpg.jpeg" alt="IMG_20170704_202610223.jpg" /></p> <p>Then came the next part: building the shed.</p> <p><img src="http://jim.am/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_20170707_121236887_HDR.jpg.jpeg" alt="IMG_20170707_121236887_HDR.jpg" /></p> <p>It turns out the box was a little bigger than we thought. The sales guy at the store suggested we rent a pickup truck and take it home. We decided to have it delivered and I am glad we did because holy smokes - it weighs close to 400 lbs. There would be no way BW and I could move that.</p> <p>Now that I’ve got the shed up next is to get the floor prepped for the new one, and I am good to go.</p> <p>The actual building of the shed took me about 8 hours or so. Of course, I got halfway building it and realized that I had put a part for the roof in upside down and thuderstorm while I was installing the roof was poorly timed as well.</p> <p>Also, there’s always extra screws - right?</p> <p>But I did it. I promised BW I would take care of the shed and I did:</p> <p><img src="http://jim.am/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_20170709_124943422_HDR.jpg.jpeg" alt="IMG_20170709_124943422_HDR.jpg" /></p> <p>And I think it looks a lot better than our old one too. And, it’s smaller so we can’t get more crap into it. It will hold our lawn furniture and our push mower and wheelbarrow so we’re good.</p> <p>A few notes:</p> <ol> <li></li> </ol> <p>People will take anything if it’s free. This is not the first time I had s<a href="https://jim.am/2012/05/20/what-if-we-gave-it-away/">omebody else come get my crap</a></p> <ol start="2"> <li></li> </ol> <p>I had painted the platform with some leftover paint from the garage, but now that I see it I need to re-paint a brown. The gray isn’t working.</p> <ol start="3"> <li></li> </ol> <p>The plan for the rest of the space is to get BW a little greenhouse so she can get a start on her garden for next year.</p> <ol start="4"> <li></li> </ol> <p>And some landscaping needs done around the edges</p> <p>As a bonusI realized I had some metal shelves in the shed that I didn’t even know existed. So I painted them up and installed them in the garage. I also found an old light too so I hung that in the garage so BW can see when she’s doing her crafts.</p> <p>The garage needs to be cleaned up a bit, but that’s next on the list.</p> <p><img src="http://jim.am/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_20170706_182348072.jpg.jpeg" alt="IMG_20170706_182348072.jpg" /></p> <p>And there we are. The summer of the shed is over but don’t worry as BW still has lots of other stuff for me to do.</p> <span class="meta"><time datetime="2017-07-09T21:34:05+00:00">July 9, 2017</time> &middot; </span> <!--<span class="meta"><time datetime="2017-07-09T21:34:05+00:00">July 9, 2017</time> &middot; </span> --> </section> </main> </body> </html>
