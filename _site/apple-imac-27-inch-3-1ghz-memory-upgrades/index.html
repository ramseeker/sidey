And if you buy the fast iMac from Apple directly you can configure this Apple iMac with even a faster processor running at  3.4Gz,  but in the  stock configuration you can <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YLCE2S/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004YLCE2S">buy the  3.1GHz</a></strong> is the <a href="http://www.jim.am/new-2011-apple-imac-models-announced/">fastest iMac that you can buy today from Apple</a>. All else pretty much the same. Apple offers a bigger hard drive option at 2TB, but you can upgrade the hard  drive for any iMac pretty easily so that’s not much of a feature, although if you are working in video or using large files like photoshop files or movies you can never have enough hard drive space, (or RAM, too)This specific <a href="http://www.apple.com/imac/">Apple iMac</a> model is the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YLCE2S/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004YLCE2S">fastest Apple iMac you can buy</a></strong> and also offers the biggest LCD display as well. Simply put, if you’re in the market for an Apple iMac and need the <strong>biggest and baddest Apple consumer desktop computer you can buy</strong>, then look no further than the Apple iMac 27 inch model running at 3.1 GHz.</p> <p><strong>Is the faster 27 inch iMac worth it?</strong></p> <p>I have already noted that I think the <a href="http://www.jim.am/apple-imac-21-5-inch-2-7-ghz-memory-upgrades/">Apple iMac 21.5 inch </a>is the best deal out of the two 2011 21.5 inch Apple iMacs, but if you can afford the extra $500 from the price of this Apple iMac, than the <strong>extra screen real estate from 21.5  inches  to 27 inches is quite the jump</strong>, and probably will allow you to get more work done than the processor upgrade from 2.7Ghz to 3.1. GHz. If you are deciding on what iMac to buy, the 27 inch  2.7 GHz model might be the best deal just based on the fact of screen size alone.</p> <p>I always like to <strong>compare prices of computers</strong>, where in 2011 more than ever there’s a good chance you can make money with your computer than ever before. Maybe you freelance in photography or writing and any money you make on the side could be used towards paying for your new iMac. The one good thing about Apple computers is that they tend  to hold their life well and unless you need the latest and greatest computer you can buy, <strong>an iMac should last you about 3 years or so</strong>. I’m writing this on a 2008 MacBook Pro that has paid  for itself over and over the past three years and for the work I do, I see no reason for an upgrade.</p> <p>Assuming you get 3 years out of your iMac, which is quite possible and if you <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004R6J2KW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004R6J2KW">add AppleCare for your iMac</a></strong> you’ve got a trouble free Mac desktop with full warranty, the 2.7 Ghz works out to costing $47.00 monthly, and the stock iMac 3.1 GHz works out a few dollars more at $55.00 – About eight dollars a month more.  $55 a month, and the  fastest iMac is paid  for. Less,  if you find a way to make more money with your computer. It’s quite possible to earn a living with your Mac, and as you see the <strong>price difference between the 2.7GHz and 3.1GHz Apple iMacs</strong>, when broken down over the three years is negligible.</p> <p><strong>Adding more RAM to the iMac 3.1GHz</strong></p> <p>[table id=2 /]</p> <p>Out of the box, the Apple iMac 3.1 GHz comes from Apple shipped with just <strong>8GB of RAM</strong>, which for light computer use  like checking your email, or booking a vacation, or some other rather processor light task or if you just want  to use the included iApps like iTunes and iPhoto and the like, then the 8GB of factory supplied RAM will probably do you.</p> <p>But if you’ve bought 2 grand worth of iMac to get the <strong>fastest iMac you can buy</strong> this year, you either need the added screen real estate a 27 inch iMac offers, or even more likely, you **need the processor speed **and the cheapest way to upgrade your iMac processor is to add more memory to your Apple 3.1 GHz iMac. And as long as you  don’t <strong><a href="http://store.apple.com/us/memorymodel/ME_IMAC_S11_21">buy RAM from Apple</a></strong>, you can upgrade the iMac to the full 16GB of RAM for less than $100. Actually, as I write this in the summer of 2011, less than $70 for another 8GB of  iMac RAM is quite possible.</p> <p>Once you’ve decided to buy more iMac RAM and fill the fastest iMac with as much RAM as possible, you need to buy another <strong>8GB of DDR3 1333Mhz SDRAM sodimms</strong>. There was once  a time when Apple computers were much more fussy about the memory requirements and  you needed to buy memory for specifically for Apple computers but for now those days are behind us and  as long as  you buy quality memory upgrades from memory stores you can trust, with the right memory specifications  you will have no problems when installing memory in this Apple computer or any other, either.</p> <p><strong>How to Install iMac 3.1 GHz 27 inch  Memory  Upgrades</strong></p> <p>Apple computer can show you to <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1423">install iMac RAM </a>much  better than I can, but essentially you need to place the  iMac face down on your desk (I suggest  a soft blanket  or towel so you don’t scratch that big beautiful lcd display)  and  remove the door to access the four iMac memory upgrade slots on the bottom of the iMac. There’s four slots available for memory upgrades, and two of them are going to be empty and just waiting for you to add two more <strong><a href="http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT51264BC1339">4GB DDR3 SDRAM 1333Mhz sodimms</a></strong>, or  if you prefer, an <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">8GB Apple iMac memory</a></strong> upgrade kit that bundles two 4GB DDR3 for iMac together.</p> <p>One thing you do have to be careful about when installing memory upgrades is static electricity. If you wish to be real careful you can add an anti static strap to your memory order when <strong>buying  iMac RAM</strong> but it’s really not needed if you’re careful to ground yourself, which is done by touching metal on the iMac before you touch the memory upgrade for iMacs, as the static electricity  can damage your memory upgrade.</p> <p>The <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YLCE2S/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004YLCE2S">Apple iMac 27 inch 3.1GHz</a></strong> is one fast and well designed computer and with the additional 8GB of RAM that you can install yourself and buy for much less than what Apple charges adding <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">another 8GB of RAM to the  fastest iMac</a></strong> in 2011 couldn’t be easier.</p> <span class="meta"><time datetime="2011-06-28T00:00:00+00:00">June 28, 2011</time> &middot; </span> <!--<span class="meta"><time datetime="2011-06-28T00:00:00+00:00">June 28, 2011</time> &middot; </span> --> </section> </main> </body> </html>
