<p>It was a <strong>very</strong> weird day here today, as itâs the first day where almost <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-issues-guidance-essential-services-under-new-york-state-pause-executive-order">everything is closed</a> and there was nobody out on the roads <strong>at all</strong></p>
<p>I had thought that it would be quiet, but not that quiet. I did have to go out to go pick up my car from the car repair as I needed an new oil pan plug to stop the oil  from dripping all over my driveway. The cost was $70  - so not that bad.</p>
