<p>I wonder if it’s worth it to have a pair of headphones that are worth this much. It seems like it’s a <strong>lot</strong> of  money for these headphones. Granted they are an esoteric brand and not <a href="https://amzn.to/2UwWj7d">a pair of beats headphones</a> that are another brand that are overrated for what they are..</p>
<p>I think the diminishing rate of return starts about that $500 dollar mark and anything over that you are starting to pay for what you think <em>might</em> be better sounding cans.</p>
